<p>Five years and I have never been pulled over. That's an accomplishment too, those five years are from 16-21 in a 1968 Mustang with a big V8.  Unfortunately that winning streak was ended today by a state trooper on I-80.  He pulled me over for having "an obstructed license plate".  Part of the little registration tag was covered by the plate frame.  And when I say little, I really do mean little, you can see the color and month if you want.  I think he was fishing.  I'll post pics when I get a chance.  Anyway, there goes my streak.  It was only a warning, and as a bonus I was late for work.  I'm not bitter though.</p>
