<p>I'm on the hunt for a new distro.  Mepis was driving me crazy in a few small ways, mostly that all the apps were outdated.  Don't flame me, thats just how it seemed to my weak powers of observation.  I threw Feisty Fawn Kubuntu on the other night, absolutely terrible.  Am I the only one who has Amarok freeze <u>every</u> time I start it while running Beryl?  Plus the whole Automatix song and dance got old fast.</p><p>I'm downloading the KDE version of Linux Mint right now, thought I'd give that a go. Also want to try a BSD flavor someday, I'm just so stuck in using Debian tool (e.g. apt-get) that I don't like learning new stuff.  Oh well.</p>
