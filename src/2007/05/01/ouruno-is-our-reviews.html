title: OurUNO is Our Reviews
type: post
---
<p>Well, tonight I finally got around to working on OurUNO.  I decided a long time ago to convert it to a framework around which anyone can build up a college review site.  I started cutting up the code around 9:00 and it's now 3:45 of the next day.  Ouch.</p>
<p>I naturally decided to use Smarty to template this guy, and then I decided that there was going to be a definite need for good docs.  I chose NaturalDocs and it's pretty good.  It's got 0 learning curve for the basic functionality, and outputs pretty docs.</p>
<p>I got most of the system documented tonight, and converted about, contact, index, and viewReviews to Smarty.  There are still some problems with NaturalDocs I have to figure out (like how to group files together) and lots of files to template of course.</p>
<p>I think I can have a package together within a month.  I'll hook up to sourceforge soon, maybe snag a domain.  It's actually been a lot easier than I thought it would be so far.  Smarty is pretty kickin, as is NaturalDocs. The latter could, ironically, use better documentation.</p>
