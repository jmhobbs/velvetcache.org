<p>I cleaned out my /var/www without backing it up.  There goes a whole bunch of code I don't have anywhere else.  Including the base of <a href="http://www.blowpass.com/dev">BlowPass</a> 1.0.  Hours and hours are now gone.</p>
<div class="update"><b>Update (06/01/07)</b><br/>Whew! I forgot, I tarred BlowPass 1.0 up earlier.  I'm only out about an hour or two of dev work.</div>
