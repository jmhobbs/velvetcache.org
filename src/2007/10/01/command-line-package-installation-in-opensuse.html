title: Command Line Package Installation in OpenSuSE
type: post
---
<p>One of the things I love the most about Debian is apt.  It's a great and speedy package manager.  Being able to apt-get install from the command line and not have to wait for a heavy UI to come up is a major plus for me.  Thats why I was frustrated with OpenSuSE, which we use at work.</p>
<p>First thing first, I think that the OpenSuSE package system is a pig.  Yast is a pig. Zypper is a pig.  I did, however, find the fastest route to installing via the command line, which I'll share here.</p>
<p>Unless you happen to know the <u>exact</u> name of the package you want to install, you'll need to look it up.  The fastest way I've found is using <a href="http://benjiweber.co.uk:8080/webpin/" target="_blank">Webpin</a>, a nice online package searcher.  Be careful that you are reading from the right repo though.  For example, a search on "magick++" returns many packages, including "libMagick++-devel (6.3.5.10)"  which, to my Debian eye, looks like the perfect package.  It is from an odd repo though, "Results from http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dipe/openSUSE_10.2" and the one I really want, and have access to mind you, is "ImageMagick-Magick++-devel (6.3.0.0)" which is in the main repo "Results from http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.2/repo/oss/suse".  It's already too complicated, but we soldier on.</p>
<p>With my new, exact, package name in hand, I open up a root command line.  The syntax for a zypper install is <tt>zypper install [package name]</tt> so I do <tt>zypper install ImageMagick-Magick++-devel</tt> and let it rip.  After a ridiculous amount of parsing, it figures out the dependencies and asks me to continue, which I do.  You have to babysit it for key managing, I havent figured out how to force "yes" on it. And that is how you use zypper to install on OpenSuSE.</p>
<p><pre lang="bash">root:~$ zypper install ImageMagick-Magick++-devel
