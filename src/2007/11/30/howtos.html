<p>Do you ever spend 20 minutes figuring out the perfect way to do some arcane task on the command line, only to forget it and need it again in a month? I do. A lot.</p>
<p>I started keeping a directory with little plain text documents that had the command line I wanted inside them.  I recently uploaded them to my static site and wrote a script to use them easier.</p>
<p>It's real simple, just download the howto bash script in the following directory <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/howtos/">http://static.velvetcache.org/howtos/</a> and place it in your path.  Now make a directory for your HowTo's somewhere and put the whole path into a file in your home directory called ".howto".</p><p>You should be able to call <tt>$ howto --sync</tt> and it will pull down a tar of the most current files, then expand it into your HowTo directory.</p><p>If you download the howto.tar.gz by itself, be warned that it is a tar bomb and will rudely scatter its files all over your directory.</p><p>Lastly, onceyou have some HowTo's installed, just use <tt>$ howto -l</tt> to list out the possible choices, then <tt>$ howto print-unix-timestamp</tt>, replacing "print-unix-timestamp" with the name or number of the HowTo you want.</p>
<p>Below is the howto shell script, because I like including code in my posts whenever I can.
