<p>Recently I worked on a review extension for the <a href="http://www.omahawiki.org/">Omaha Wiki</a>.  They wanted to give users of the wiki the ability to write reviews for pages, while still keeping control of the content and separating the factual information from the opinions.</p><p>Initially I just worked on adapting the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Rating">Rating</a> extension by Sanford Poon,  but it was getting hard to deal with and make all the changes that were needed, so I started over.</p><p>The end result is VCReviews which combines the rating and review process into one submission, and is only accessible by logged in users.  You can check it out at the <a href="http://www.omahawiki.org/">Omaha Wiki</a>.  Just pick an article and click on a "reviews" tab.</p><p>Source is available: <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2007/11/4/vcreviews-a-mediawiki-extension/VCReviews.0.2.2.tar.gz">VCReviews Version 0.2.2</a></p>
