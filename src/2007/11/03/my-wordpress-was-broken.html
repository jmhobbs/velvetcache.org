<p>Whew. My WordPress was broken for a while now.  I did an update using Dreamhost's one-click installs and it blew to pieces.  Obviously I have it working again though :) Never found the problem, just did it from scratch.</p><p>Also switched to a new highlighting plugin. I like it better, but I had to hand correct all my tags, so if I missed some, my bad.</p>
