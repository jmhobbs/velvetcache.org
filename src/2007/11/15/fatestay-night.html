<p>So I finished Fate/stay night a few evenings ago.  It's 24 episodes and I really, really enjoyed it.  Definitely in my top three.</p><p>The art varied a little bit, with some stellar work and some average fare, but overall it tended towards good I thought.  Some things in the storyline went a bit under-explained, but that's really to be expected from an anime made after a detailed game.</p><p>What made this show so great were the characters and how they interacted and grew.  Really great relationships, even if the dialog was a bit spotty.  I also had the fan sub version, so that might have contributed to weak dialog as they tend to be in a rush to publish. Make no mistake though, very good storyline and very good character development.</p><p>The only thing I outright didn't like was the ending. It wasn't necessarily a <u>bad</u> ending, it was quite powerful and brought closure to the sotry, but it just wasn't the one I would have preferred.  A follow up series would be awesome, and could fix the ending for me, but as far as I know isn't really in the works.</p><p>Overall a great show, I give it an A.</p>
