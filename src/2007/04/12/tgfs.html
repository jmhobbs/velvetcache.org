<p>TGFS - Thank Goodness For Scripting.  I love it.  I wrote a pair of scripts to rip over <u>3600</u> class numbers and names for <a href="http://www.ouruno.com/" target="_blank">OurUNO</a> and dump them into my DB.  That would have taken forever, but it gives me an awesome head start on the site now.  Regex's rock, you can't deny it.</p><p>You can take a peek at the second hacked together script, <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/external/highlighter/full.php?file_id=13">here</a>.  It's the beast that does the stripping.</p>
