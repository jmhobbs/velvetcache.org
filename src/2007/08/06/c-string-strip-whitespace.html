title: C++ String Strip Whitespace
type: post
wp_id: "176"

<p>I was at work today and had the hardest time trying to find a function that could strip out whitespace from a string.  There isn't one built into C++, and I can't just add on libraries (e.g. boost) just for this sort of one-time use item.  I couldn't find an easy drop in on the web either, so I wrote my own based on a templating system I had made.</p>
<p><pre lang="cpp" line="1">string trimstring (string toTrim) {
	
	size_t found;
	found = toTrim.find(" ");

	while(toTrim.length() != 0 && found != string::npos) {
		toTrim.erase(found,1);		
		found = toTrim.find(" ");
	}
	
	return toTrim;
	
}</pre></p><p>Very brute-force, but easy to understand right?</p>
