<p>I didn't write about it, but I changed from Ubuntu to Mepis a few days ago.  I'm going to be honest, I really liked gnome, but I'm actually liking KDE more so far.  My main complaint is I have to make everything smaller in KDE, all the defaults are stinkin huge.</p><p>I figured Mepis was a safe bet from Ubuntu, they're related and Mepis has the Ubuntu repo's included. Plus, I had used Mepis before, and I happen to like pyramids.</p>
