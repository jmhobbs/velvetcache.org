title: C++ Print Binary Function
type: post
---
<p>A while back I used a function I found on the web to print off a binary representation of a number while I was working on a <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2007/03/08/bitwise-operators-and-blowfish/">blowfish implementation</a> in C++.  I haven't finished the blowfish, but I made some changes to the binary function, and thought I'd post it since it is a handy thing to have.</p>
<p>Essentially all I did was set it so it grouped the digits by 4 and padded out the MSB set with 0's so they all line up.</p>
<p><pre lang="cpp" line="1">void binary(int number,int count=0) {
  int remainder;
  
  count++;
  
  if(number <= 1) {
    while(count % 4 != 0) {
      cout << '0';
      count++;
    }
    cout << number;
    return;
  }
  
  remainder = number%2;
  binary(number >> 1, count);
  if(count % 4 == 0)
    cout << ' ';
  cout << remainder;
}</pre></p>
<p>Here's an example program, and the results.</p>
<p><pre lang="cpp" line="1">#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void binary(int number,int count=0) {
...
}

int main () {
	binary(0);
	cout << endl;
	binary(0xFF);
	cout << endl;
	binary(9872);
	cout << endl;
}</pre></p>

1111 1111
0010 0110 1001 0000
