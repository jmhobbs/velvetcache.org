<p>I had never really tried to do anything with XML.  Looking at an XML file with no help is an intimidating prospect.  I figured it was too complicated to bother with, and it's just for storing things right?</p>
<p>In my file structures class we've gotten to XML recently, and today I did my homework for that section.  Holy cow is XML cool when you combine it with XSL.  The ability to translate a plain XML doc into some nice, clean, formatted XHTML, or really pretty much anything you want is pretty cool.  Now I understand.</p>
