<p>A few days ago I finally gave in to the two-for-one tablet deal at geeks.com.  On a side note, I've always had very good luck with geeks.com, good stuff, right price, no problems.  Anyway, I gave in and bought myself two of the <a href="http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WP5540" target="_blank">DigiPro 5.5"x4"</a> drawing tablets, Model No. WP5540.  I tried to find some compatability information about the tablet and linux, but couldn't.</p>
<p>I got it yesterday, hooked it up and its working just fine.  I don't know about the "512 Pressure Levels", since I'm not sure what app on my machine would take pressure levels anyway.  The GIMP didn't seem to act any different however.  I did uncomment the information for a wacom tablet in my xorg.conf and restarted my X server, but I haven't tried it without that change, so it may not be necessary.</p>
<p>5.5"x4" is about as small as it sounds, but it really isn't that big of a deal.  There is plenty of fine control on the tablet, and it's more than big enough for me.  I intend to use it when I'm working in the gimp, for fine control of the lasso tool, etc.  If it had a scroll wheel on it, I think I'd replace my mouse, it's that comfy.  Plus you can roll the pen between fingers and type just fine.  No more grabbing the mouse every few seconds.</p>
<p>For the record I'm on Mepis, whatever is current there, with kernel 2.6.15-26-386.</p>
