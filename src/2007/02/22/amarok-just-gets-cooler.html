<p>It's all in the details man.  All of it.  Okay not all of it, but a whole huge honkin lot of it.</p>
<p>I had added some <a href="http://www.relientk.com/" target="_blank">Relient K</a> albums to my playlist, but I wanted them higher in the list (right under <a href="http://www.runkidrun.net/" target="_blank">Run Kid Run</a>) so I selected and dragged them upwards.  What did my eyes behold? Something I didn't expect.  I stuck the cover art from the albums right there next to the cursor.  </p><p>How cool is that?</p><p>Now, I don't know if this essentially useless feature is in any other music program, but it's got me dragging stuff around and making little collages out of cover art.</p>
