<p>It's a momentous occasion! Today, as of 1/25/07, I am the top-ranked page on Google for the search terms "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=expired+mayonnaise" target="_blank">expired mayonnaise</a>".
All because of this little post: <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/11/27/expired-mayonnaise-really-doesnt-taste-all-that-different/">Expired Mayonnaise Really Doesn't Taste All That Different</a>.  My mother would be so proud.  I think I'm going to make a little tracker to see how long I can stay in spot #1.  It will be a grand experiment in SEO.</p>
