<p>This is something I've needed to do occasionally and always have to look up.  The one I like best is located at <a href="http://www.liamdelahunty.com/tips/linux_search_and_replace_multiple_files.php" target="_blank">this post</a> but I'm going to repeat it here for posterity and so I can find it again easier.</p>
<p><code>perl -pi -w -e 's/search/replace/g;' *.php</code></p>
<p>So easy, thats why Perl rocks.  Thank you Bob Fulkerson for introducing us.</p>
<p>Other options include the frickin sweet looking ruby app <a href="http://arachnoid.com/ruby/searchReplaceGlobal/index.html" target="_blank">SearchAndReplaceGlobal</a> by the same guy who wrote the editor I first learned to do HTML with, <a href="http://vps.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/" target="_blank">Arachnophilia</a>. I say sweet <i>looking</i> because I never actually got it running.  I didn't try very hard though.</p>
