title: Music I've Never Played
type: post
---
<p>I was looking at the "Smart Playlists" on Amarok today.  One of them is the "Never Played" playlist. It's all of the music on my machine that the Amarok DB says I've never played, obviously.  I decided to play it through and listen to some stuff that's getting dusty on the back shelves, figuratively speaking. Now I 've got 3805 songs to listen to, that's about 1 week and 3 days worth of music.  My collection is only 4200 songs large.  This will be a good thing, though it might send my last.fm haywire.</p>
