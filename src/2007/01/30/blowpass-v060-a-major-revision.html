<p>Just finished up BlowPass 0.60.  This was a major overhaul of the system, and there are very few similarities between the 0.50 and 0.60.  Here's a quick roundup of <u>every</u> change (Or at least those I could remember.)</p>
<p><b>New Domain</b><br/>That's right, BlowPass now has it's own domain, <a href="http://www.blowpass.com/" target="_blank">BlowPass.com</a>  Now you can get there quick, none of this sub-domain garbage anymore.  This isn't really a code change, but it's still a nice feature.</p>
<p><b>Installer!</b><br/>Just kidding that's not done yet.</p>
<p><b>New Logo</b><br/><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2007/1/30/blowpass-v060-a-major-revision/logo.gif" alt="BlowPass Logo" /><br/>Sexy new reflected logo.  It can only be beat by...</p>
<p><b>New Layout</b><br/>After months of market research we have a new layout.
It's clean, it fits in an 800x600 screen and it's very blue.  Plus...</p>
<p><b>The Log Is Optional</b><br/>If you don't want to see the technobabble, don't open it.</p>
<p><b>Partial JSON</b><br/>Smaller responses mean faster loads. Hopefully I'll get around to moving it all into JSON and then we'll be even faster.</p>
<p><b>Compressed Libraries</b><br/>Everything has been squashed by the DoJo thingy. (Or will be soon.)</p>
<p><b>Prototype 1.5</b><br/>Because hipness matters.</p>
<p><b>Sorting</b><br/>You can now sort your items by last modified date, name, or...</p>
<p><b>Item Type</b><br/>There are now several item types, "Network Account", "System Account" are active by default, and if you think there should be another, let me know!</p>

<p>Okay, wasn't that exciting?  Here's something even more exciting, the planned changes for V0.70.</p>
<p><b>Cleaner Code</b><br/>There are a lot of repetitive chunks that need making into function calls.</p>
<p><b>JSON</b><br/>More JSON for transmission, less delimited strings. Also, switch JSON to native when we get to PHP 5.2</p>
<p><b>SSL</b><br/>This kind of service really needs SSL, but I don't have the $189 to get that done at this point.  If you really want to be secure, do what I do, run it on your home machine with your own SSL cert.</p>
<p><b>Delete Functionality</b><br/>Finally add the 'delete' button for items now that we're using PHP sessions.</p>
<p><b>Create New Types</b><br/>User created item types should be done soon too.</p>
<p>We'll see how it goes from here, could be a few months before the next release.</p>
