<p>Whoa! Post 100 for this little blog.  Although at times it's been a little <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/10/27/sunchips-and-mountain-dew/" target="_blank">weak</a> <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/09/08/technocrati-post/" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/10/02/katamari-damacy/" target="_blank">content</a>, I think there have been enough good ones to outweigh them.  Besides, this site is more for me than for anyone else.
</p>
<p>As this is post 100, I'm required by a dubious interpretation of a little known Norwegian law to list my favorite posts so far. So here they are, slightly categorized.</p>

<p>Now to the meat of this post!
When I was first hired at UNO I was given the transfer articulation site as a project.  What they basically do is keep track from year to year what each class at a number of schools is equivalent to here at UNO.  I wrote it pretty quick, and they've been slowly adding data by hand for a few months now.</p>
<p>It's <u>a lot</u> of data to enter too.  So far they only have one year of one school done.  The old system was a series of static HTML pages, so they didn't think they could load it into the new system.  I didn't agree fully, because although the pages were poorly written and differed from year to year, they had a standard table layout on each one.  I got to work on the idea of extracting the old data and loading it into the new database.</p>
<p>The first thing to do was create a syntactically correct file, here's a sample of part of one of the files:
<pre lang="html">...
      <TD> 
        <CENTER>
          Max.<br/>
          Transfer Hours<br/>
          Allowed 
        </CENTER>
      <TD> 
        <P> 
          <CENTER>
            Comments 
          </CENTER>
    <TR> 
      <TD height="33"> 
        <P>ARCH1300
      
      <TD> 
        <P>Architectural Desktop I
...</pre> Nasty, all-caps and they didn't even close the tags.  Ugly, ugly.</p>
<p>Luckily I knew of a secret weapon, <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">HTML Tidy</a>!
When run through with the appropriate flags I got this lovely version of the code:
<pre lang="html">...
<td>
<div class="c2">
Comments
</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td height="33">
<p>ARCH1300</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>Architectural Desktop I</p>
</td>
....</pre></p>
<p>Okay, so running the tidy command on <u>every</u> file one at a time would be crazy, so I wrote up a short batch file to hit every single .html file with the tidy love.  Please excuse the nasty one-lined-ness of it.
<pre lang="dos">FOR %%f IN ("*.html") DO tidy %%f --char-encoding utf8 --clean yes --doctype strict --escape-cdata yes --indent auto --indent-attributes no --join-classes yes --output-xhtml yes --show-errors 99 --tidy-mark no --wrap 0 -m "%%f"</pre></p>
<p>Okay, so now that we've got that beautified file, we need to parse it.  To make life easier I stripped all the other tags out except for the table tags with PHP's <a href="http://www.php.net/strip_tags" target="_blank" title="string strip_tags ( string str [, string allowable_tags] )">strip_tags()</a>.  I then regexed out anything that wasn't inside the <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> tags and created my SimpleXML object with what was left over.
<pre lang="php" line="1">$filename = $_REQUEST['dir'].'/'.$_REQUEST['file'];
// Remove the space in fopen, it's a Wordpress thing. :(
$handle = f open($filename, "r");
$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
fclose($handle);
$contents = strip_tags($contents,'<table><tr><td>');

if(preg_match('/<table.*>([.\r\n]*)<\/table>/si', $contents, $matches)) {
	print 'Will attempt to load. ';
	$contents = $matches[0];
	
	$xml = new SimpleXMLElement($contents);
	
	if(!$xml) {
		print 'Error! XML Didn\'t read right.';
		exit();
	}
		
	print 'Load complete.  Checking for expected structure. ';
	
	if(trim($xml->tr[0]->td[0]) != 'Course') {
		print 'Error! Structure not as expected. Dumping.<br/>';
		var_dump($xml);
		exit();
	}
}</pre></p>
<p>A few loops and a whole lot of boring processing later and it's all in the DB.  But that's the gist of the system and it's frickin tight.</p>
