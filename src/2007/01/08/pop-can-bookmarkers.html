<p>I saw some cool "bookdarts" on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/books/stuff-we-like--book-darts-225288.php" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a> today under the "Things We Like" category.  I've been tearing through a bunch of books I got for Christmas this year and have just been using scraps of paper and the like for keeping my place.  These looked cool and I thought I'd try making my own.</p>
<p>I was going to use some flashing from out in the garage, but I couldn't find it. Instead I ended up using a pop can as my material source. It worked out nice and the cans cut easily. Make sure you round the corners or you might snag or hurt yourself. Also a pair of needle noses are nice for pressing the folds in them, just don't go too tight because they'll be tough to place and remove.</p>
<p>They aren't as neat 'n tidy as "real" <a href="http://www.bookdarts.com/" target="_blank">BookDarts</a> and take up a bit of your time, but you can't beat the price and if you fold them the other way you can have nice colored ones from different can types.</p>
