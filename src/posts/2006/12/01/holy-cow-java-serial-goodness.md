title: Holy Cow, Java Serial Goodness!

I got my Arduino board today, and I went to check out the IDE.  It's written in Java.  Holy freakin' cow.  Couldn't be more perfect because it's all written and released under the [LGPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License)!  I found the [Serial.java](http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/arduino/trunk/app/Serial.java?view=markup) in the SVN trunk, and I'm reasonably certain I can figure it out enough to use it.  You wouldn't believe how happy I am right now.  I need some breadboard and LED's.
