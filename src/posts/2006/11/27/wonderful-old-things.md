I was wandering through the contents of an old hard drive and found some neat stuff I made back in freshman year.  The first article is a spastic little animated gif of a few pages of notebook paper.  Sam Hair.  Rad.

The next two are videos.  One is a painfully rotoscoped video of my room mate Joe swinging a light saber around.  The next is a short claymation of a turtle and a bird.  I had a lot of spare time freshman year. Click the links to view them.
