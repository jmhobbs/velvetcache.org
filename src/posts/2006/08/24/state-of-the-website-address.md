I've been wokring on alot of web apps recently, and I've been cleaning up the 404's and misc. pages around velvetcache.

Today I tried (reasonably hard) to get [typo](http://www.typosphere.org/) running.  I never did, probably because there seems to be absolutely no documentation out there and I don't know ruby.  Instead I dropped in a copy of [WordPress](http://wordpress.com) using [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/)'s excellent One-Click install system.

I've got to say, WordPress is extremely nifty, and the amount of plugins is enormous.  If you want to look at it it's at [http://typo.velvetcache.org/](http://typo.velvetcache.org/) _(dead link)_, though to be honest it's just a wordpress blog with some broken css (plugin issues).

I'm going to play with it some more and try to theme it.  It's a really nice app with lots of support, and to be honest, I doubt I'll ever "finish" my system (I'm still inserting new blog posts via phpMyAdmin!) and even if I do, it won't be anywhere near as cool.  I guess we'll see.
