I just updated my install of [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/), which is possibly the greatest music player / jukebox ever.  I'd heard alot about the new version, most of it being about the new native capability to play last.fm radio streams without any hacks.

I have to say, I like the new version, it's gotten a bit of a facelift and somethings have changed.  I like the fact that your collection has alphabetic dividers, it makes it easier to find artists.

The site claims that it has added support for MTP devices, but I haven't hooked my precious [Zen MicroPhoto](http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=14107) up to it yet.  Anyway, just putting up a post recommending the new Amarok.
