I saw Ozma at Knickerbockers in Lincoln last right.  Awesome show.  They played for a long time, and we got them to play an encore of Battlescars and Rocks as well.  Those guys are so awesome.

With them were "Everybody Else", who I liked.  They were, in Adam's words, "Rooney meets the Beach Boys".  Good band, though it took forever to get them set up so they didn't play as long (I think).

Also there was an amazing band from Lincoln that I have once again forgotten their name.  Wilson, or something.  Good bar band, the guitarist could really make his firebird scream.

#### Update (10/25/06)

The Lincoln band's name is [Willis](http://ilikewillis.com/) and they are delicious.
