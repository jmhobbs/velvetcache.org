I'm in a Linux distribution!  Well, sorta.  A wallpaper I made is the default background in an alpha build of fluxbuntu.  If you go get nBuild1-Revision2 from [fluxbuntu.org](http://fluxbuntu.org/) that background is of my design.  Also, if you just go to the fluxbuntu.org page it's the background in the screenshot.

It's kinda neat, I posted it to the forums as an alternative to the boring white default and they added it to the distro. Too bad I'm at school with no way to burn the disc and install it to my laptop.  Maybe I'll download it and make a QEMU style USB version.  Then I'd have to buy a USB stick... This isn't working out. Oh well.

P.S. This is a good, light distro btw.  My current fave for my old PIII laptop.
