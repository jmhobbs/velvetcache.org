title: Gregarius And Google Reader Update
type: post
wp_id: "56"

I just finished installing [Gregarius](http://gregarius.net/) because I wanted to access my feeds no matter where I was and have a consistent read/unread status across all machines.  Before I used to use RSSOwl, which is a great app, but when I got home I would have to go through and "read" items I had already read elsewhere. I had tried [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader), but there weren't enough features.

Sure enough, as soon as I installed [Gregarius on Dreamhost](http://rss.velvetcache.org/) one of the first feed's was Robert Scoble's.  It was a brief on the [new Google Reader features](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/09/28/google-reader-updates-and-a-video-too/).  I'm going to try out the new Google Reader, but for now I'll leave Gregarius installed, as it's a very nice application.
