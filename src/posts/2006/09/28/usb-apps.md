I'm a fan of portable applications.  One of my professors used portable Firefox in class once, and now I'm hooked.  It's so handy to have every program I need right at my fingertips on any (windows) machine I use.  So what apps are on my 1Gb disk's right now?

**[PStart](http://www.pegtop.de/start/)**

This little system-tray launcher is the backbone of any good USB apps setup.  Easy to configure and handy to have around.

**Eclipse and JDK 1.5**

Thats right, I've got a Java compiler wherever I go.  I haven't had any problems with this yet, and since it's got the JRE in there too, Eclipse can run anywhere.  This was a little more trouble to install than most, but really not all that bad.  [Instructions](/category/computers/software/eclipse/).

**[Firefox](http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable)**

Nothing better than having all your extensions with you, and all you cache and history to yourself. Thats really all there is to say.  If there is one app that I use the most on USB, it's Firefox

[![PuTTY Config](https://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/PuTTY_sm.png)](https://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/PuTTY.png)

**[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)**

This is _the_ terminal application to use on Windows.  It's easy to use, small, portable, and reliable. I use it almost every day to get onto Vulcan or my home machines.

**[WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php)**

This falls into the same category as PuTTY.  It's a great all-around file transfer client with secure protocols built in.  Great application.

**[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm)**

For a long time I was looking for a simple text editor that had syntax highlighting, but was light and easy.  I tried cream for a time then I found Notepad++.  It works quite well.

**[RealVNC Viewer](http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/winvncviewer.html)**

For those times when you can't get something done over SSH in the terminal, I use RealVNC to get to my desktop and take care of it.

**[Xlight FTPD](http://www.xlightftpd.com/)**

 Take an FTP server with you wherever you go.  Not useful very often, but when it is, it's great.

[![KisKis Entry](https://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/KisKis_sm.png)](https://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/KisKis.png)

**[KisKis](http://kiskis.sourceforge.net/)**

Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe.  This is a good java password manager.  It's java, thus cross-platform, which is key for a password safe.

**Photoshop CS**

This one is a bit shady.  I bet you didn't know that Adobe made a portable Photoshop CS.  They don't.

**[Gaim](http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/gaim_portable)**

Gaim is an instant message client, you can do AIM, MSN, Jabber, even IRC.

**[RSSOwl](http://www.quate.net/newsnet/read.php?id=32)**

The best RSS reader I've ever found.  Plus it's java, so with some tweaked scripts this can run on linux and windows, all of the USB stick.

**[Foxit PDF Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php)**

I hate Acrobat Reader with a passion.  Foxit is light and free.

**[Explore_USB.bat](https://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/Explore_USB.bat)**

In addition to my standard programs I have a few simple batch files I made to ease the use of my USB apps.  These are simple one-liners, but they are handy to have around.  First among them is my `Explore_USB.bat`.  I got tired of all the effort involved in opening an explorer window on my drive.  Since I have a my portable apps separated from the rest of the drive I used `..` to jump to my drive root.  This one comes into use most of all the batch files.

```
@start explorer ..
```

**[cmd.bat](https://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/cmd.bat)**

This one is another obvious one, launch a "dos" command window without getting the start panel involved.  Like I said, these are really simple shortcut files.

```@start cmd```

**[DSLinux](http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/)**

This is a nice, full distribution that uses Knoppix to pack a ton of apps into a 50 meg disc.  I use the "embedded" version which comes with qemu binaries for windows and linux. No matter where I am I have a linux machine. As long as its not on a mac I guess. This has it's own 1 gig stick, lots of /home space.
