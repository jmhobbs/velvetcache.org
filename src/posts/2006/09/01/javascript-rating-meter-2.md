In between classes today I updated the [meter](/2006/08/31/javascript-rating-meter/).  It's essentially the same script, just it changes background images now, instead of having transparent images.  I only did it for the pretty-factor since I had made the nice stars already.  Once I've written it into an un-intrusive script, which is turning out to be a bit harder than I thought, I'll likely swap it back and make it some better graphics.

Still cool, and with a few more lines could actually be used.
