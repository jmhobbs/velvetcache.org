I've been working on a project in the background, and just recently petitioned sourceforge.net for an official listing. Basically it is an Ajax driven, modular groupware suite.

I got this idea as I looked for a nice, online address book.  This led to finding several good groupware suites, such as the excellent [phpGroupware](http://www.phpgroupware.org/), and [PHPProjekt](http://www.phprojekt.com/). While these are great apps, I really didn't need such beastly and large applications.  So I designed a quick address book, and decided to use Cody Lindley's [thickbox](http://codylindley.com/Javascript/257/thickbox-one-box-to-rule-them-all) to add a coolness factor of, like, a zillion.

While it may have been way cool, it still wasn't quite what I wanted.  Given recent developments in my programmer-life I've decided to start anew.  I intend to make a windowed environment, similar to the windowing system that is on my index page.  I'll also tie in lots of ajax and plenty of [moo.fx](http://moofx.mad4milk.net/) for bling. I'm also going to use the [smarty](http://smarty.php.net/) template system to make it sleek and easy to customize.  I'll keep you posted.
