title: Hard subs with mencoder, or, annotating screencasts for free.

<p>I was working on a screen cast for a project and I could not get anything to work the way I wanted to. I didn't have the desire to purchase software, so I sought a way to annotate it for free.  I tried a half dozen free and open source video editors, with no real luck.  Either they choked on the format I captured (from CamStudio) or they didn't have a readily available inline text tool.</p>
<p>What I ended up using was plain old subtitles, plus the handyman's secret weapon, <tt>mplayer/mencoder</tt>.</p>
<p>Here's what I did.  I fired up the video in VLC and found the points where I wanted to put my subtitle help text.  Subtitle files are usually pretty straight forward.  I chose the <tt>.srt</tt> format, which is plain text. You can edit by hand, or you can use a tool, I used the aptly named <a href="http://home.gna.org/subtitleeditor/" target="_blank">subtitleeditor</a>. Which, by the way, barfed on my video file.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the resulting <tt>.srt</tt> file: <pre lang="text">1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Welcome to the product gallery walk through.

Insert title and description.

</pre></p>
<p>Next I needed to turn those "soft" subs into "hard" ones. This is where <tt>mplayer/mencoder</tt> come in.  To add soft subs to a video in <tt>mplayer</tt>, you use the <tt>-sub</tt> option.  Running this in <tt>mplayer</tt> first is a good way to see how it will look at tweak it according to the <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html#OSD/SUBTITLE%20OPTIONS" target="_blank">many options</a> you have.  I went with the defaults, it looks pretty good that way.</p>
<p>Lastly, I needed a good <tt>mencoder</tt> recipe to pull it all together. After lots of searching I found a great MPEG4 one <a href="http://personal.cscs.ch/~mvalle/mencoder/mencoder.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It's a two pass system, and the crucial piece is in calculating the bitrate: <pre lang="text">bitrate = 50 * 25 * width_of_video * height_of_video / 256</pre></p>
<p>My bitrate was 2540600. After you get that, you just plug it into the two passes below. This includes my subtitle options. <pre lang="text">mencoder -o /dev/null -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=msmpeg4v2:vpass=1:vbitrate=2540600:mbd=2:keyint=132:vqblur=1.0:cmp=2:subcmp=2:dia=2:mv0:last_pred=3 -nosound -sub MySubTitles.srt -subfont-text-scale 3 RawScreenCast.avi
mencoder -o FinishedScreenCast.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=msmpeg4v2:vpass=2:vbitrate=2540600:mbd=2:keyint=132:vqblur=1.0:cmp=2:subcmp=2:dia=2:mv0:last_pred=3 -nosound -sub MySubTitles.srt -subfont-text-scale 3 RawScreenCast.avi</pre></p>
<p>It takes a while but not too long.  When all was said and done I had a perfect hard-subbed version and it shrank my file size from ~550MB to 7.6MB. That is a great encoding recipe.</p>
