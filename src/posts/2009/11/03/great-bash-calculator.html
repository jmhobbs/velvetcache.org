<p>I spend a lot of time on the command line,  and one thing I run up against every once in a while is doing math.  I normally jump through the <tt>bc</tt> hoops,  but today this bit came through my feed reader.</p>
<p><pre lang="bash">calc(){ awk "BEGIN{ print $* }" ;}</pre></p>
<p>Just drop it into your .bashrc, .alias, or whatever else you use.</p>
<p><pre lang="text">jmhobbs@asuka:~$ calc 9*100+14/10
901.4
jmhobbs@asuka:~$</pre></p>
<p>Great solution using existing tools, props to <a href="http://tinyhacker.com/hacks/the-geeky-command-prompt-calculator/" target="_blank">TinyHacker.com</a> for this one.</p>
