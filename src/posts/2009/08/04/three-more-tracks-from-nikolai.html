<p>Nikolai is dead. Long live Nikolai.</p>
<p>Before the band split up we recorded three last songs that we wrote near the end of our run, which had limited plays but lots of our love in them. I don't think they are ever going to be polished beyond these versions, so I give you those three songs now.</p>
<p><b>1) r = 1 - sin(&theta;)</b> - <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/08/04/three-more-tracks-from-nikolai/01 - r = 1 - sin(t).mp3">Download</a><br/>This is song I wrote for Darcy, it's the most finished of the three.</p>
<p><b>2) Sokold</b> - <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/08/04/three-more-tracks-from-nikolai/02 - Sokold.mp3">Download</a><br/> Kind of an Arctic Monkeys feel to it. Or that's the idea at least.</p>
<p><b>3) Southern Rocks of Ages</b> - <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/08/04/three-more-tracks-from-nikolai/03 - Southern Rock of Ages.mp3">Download</a><br/> Energetic praise song, much more fun to play live.</p>
