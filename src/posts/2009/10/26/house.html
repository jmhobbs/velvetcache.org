<p>Okay, so it's been a while since we actually closed, but I've been busy.</p><p>Darcy and I bought our first house (thank you $8,000 tax credit) at the end of September.</p><p>It's not huge, about the same size as our apartment actually, but we love it, especially the back yard.</p><p>We finished moving in on Saturday, so everything is out of the apartment, but not really un-packed.</p><p>Stop by some time for a tour ;-)</p>
