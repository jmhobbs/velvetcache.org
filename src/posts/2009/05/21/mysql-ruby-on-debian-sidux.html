<p>
I've started learning Ruby on Rails, and I needed the mysql driver.  Should be simple,
right? Just <tt>gem install mysql</tt> or something?
</p>

<p>It wasn't.
<pre lang="bash">
root@asuka:~# gem install mysql
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...

<p>Once tangled mess of Google, Debian, and Ruby later, I found a bug report and a solution (for me at least).</p>

<p><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=373843">Debian Bug 373843</a> - Long story short, you need <tt>ruby1.8-dev</tt> or, it appears, <tt>libmysql-ruby</tt>.</p>
