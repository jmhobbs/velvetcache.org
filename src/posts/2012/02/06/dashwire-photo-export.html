<p>I used to have a Windows phone, and I used a cool service called <a href="http://dashwire.com/" target="_blank">Dashwire</a> to sync all my photos, contacts, etc. to the web.</p>
<p>Dashwire is shutting down this month, which is sad, but I haven't used it in a long time, since I switched to Android.  However, I've still got photos on there, and I'd like to grab them before they are gone. Unfortunately, Dashwire doesn't have an easy export option that I could find.</p>
<p>So, pass one involved the photos RSS feed available on the site.  I wrote this script to grab the feed, parse and download the photos.</p>
<p><pre lang="python" line="1">import sys
import time
import feedparser
import urllib

if 2 > len( sys.argv ):
  print "usage: %s <dashwire username>" % ( sys.argv[0], )
  exit(1)

url = 'http://dashwire.com/%s/photos/feed' % ( sys.argv[1], )

print "Fetching: ", url

rss = feedparser.parse( url )

for item in rss.entries:
  timestamp  = time.strftime( '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', item.date_parsed )
  file_url   = item.media_content[0]['url'].replace( '-mobile.jpg', '.jpg' )
  file_local = '%s - %s.jpg' % ( timestamp, item.title )

  print "Downloading %s to %s" % ( file_url, file_local )

  request = urllib.urlopen( file_url )
  with open( file_local, 'wb' ) as handle:
    handle.write( request.read() )
  request.close()</pre></p>
<p>It works as advertised, but it only drags down public photos, and only the most recent 30.</p>
<p>For round two I opened up the Dashwire dashboard and poked around their AJAX calls.</p>
<p>Turns out they have an <tt>images.json</tt> which has entries for every one of your photos in it.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript" line="1">[{
  "rotation": 0,
  "unique_id": "-1294276037.2068.1142222",
  "modified_at": 1252717454,
  "body": null,
  "title": null,
  "seconds": 1252373668,
  "guid": "aWGu0CNZGr3OCJadbiFPIW",
  "private": true,
  "bucket": "media3.dashwire.com",
  "tags": [],
  "type": "Image",
  "id": 6734053,
  "height": 1920,
  "comments_count": 0,
  "ratings_average": 0,
  "width": 2560
},...]</pre></p>
<p>To get this file, log into the dashboard, then download <tt>http://my.dashwire.com/images.json</tt>.</p>
<p>Once you have that, you will also need to figure out your user guid.  You can do that with JavaScript, it's stored in <tt>Dashwire.User.guid</tt>.</p>
<p><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2012/02/06/dashwire-photo-export/user-guid.png" title="Dashwire.User.guid" /></p>
<p>Then just plug it into the script below to get your stuff out!</p>
<p><pre lang="python" line="1">import sys
import time
import json
import urllib

USER_KEY = '[get this from dashwire]'
obj = None

with open( 'images.json', 'r' ) as handle:
  obj = json.loads( handle.read() )

for image in obj:
  file_url = 'http://%s/media/%s/%s.jpg' % ( image['bucket'], USER_KEY, image['guid'] )
  timestamp = time.strftime( '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.localtime( image['seconds'] ) )
  file_local = '%s - %s.jpg' % ( timestamp, image['title'] )

  print "Downloading %s to %s" % ( file_url, file_local )

  request = urllib.urlopen( file_url )
  with open( file_local, 'wb' ) as handle:
    handle.write( request.read() )
  request.close()</pre></p>
<p>Now sit back and enjoy as it downloads your photos!</p>
<p><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2012/02/06/dashwire-photo-export/my-photos.png" title="Got 'em!" /></p>
<p>Hurry up though, it all shuts down on Febuary 15th</p>
