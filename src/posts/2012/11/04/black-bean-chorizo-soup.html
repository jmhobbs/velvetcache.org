<p>For a soup party at the Gates' house I made a black bean chorizo soup.  I wanted to make this because of a soup I had at <a href="http://droverrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">The Drover</a>, and I loved it.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2012/11/04/black-bean-chorizo-soup/black_bean_chorizo.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2012/11/04/black-bean-chorizo-soup/black_bean_chorizo.sm.jpg" alt="My Soup!" /></a></p>
<p>I didn't find an exact recipe to use, but I found <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/spicy-black-bean-soup-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">one I thought would be a good starting point</a> and went from there.</p>
<p>Here is the version I made, and at the end I'll add some comments about what I will be trying next time.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 (4-ounce) fresh, raw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo#Mexican_chorizo" target="_blank">Mexican Chorizo</a></li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 dried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_de_%C3%A1rbol" target="_blank">Chile de Ã¡rbol</a>, seeded</li>
<li>1 dried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poblano" target="_blank">Poblano chile</a> (chile ancho), seeded</li>
<li>3 (15-ounce) cans black beans</li>
<li>1 canned chipotle chile, diced</li>
<li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
<li>1/2 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li>Grated sharp cheddar cheese, for serving</li>
<li>Sliced green onions, for serving</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Make a few small cuts in the chorizo with a knife. Place in your soup pot over high heat in 1/2 an inch of water.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil, then cover with a lid and lower head to medium-low. When sausages are firm (about 10 minutes) uncover and raise the heat to medium.</p>
<p>While they are boiling, place the chile de Ã¡rbol and chile ancho in a food processor and break them up.  They don't have to turn to powder, but you don't want any large chunks.</p>
<p>Let the water boil off, then brown the sausages a bit in their own oil.  Remove the sausages and set aside.</p>
<p>Pour in a very little water, maybe a 1/4 of a cup to deglaze the pan, then add the olive oil.  Turn the heat up to medium-high and add the garlic, ground up dried peppers, and half of the onions.</p>
<p>Saute until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. At the same time, cut your chorizo into 1/2" slices, then halve those slices and add to the onions as you go.</p>
<p>Add the black beans, diced chipotle pepper and broth. Simmer for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Blend half the soup as smooth as you can, then stir in the other half of the onions and simmer for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Dish it up, top with the cheddar and sliced green onions.</p>

<h3>What I will do differently next time.</h3>

<p>For texture, it came out thinner than I envisioned, so I would cut the chicken stock in half and replace it with equivalent purÃ©ed black beans. I might also consider adding some heavy cream to it, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I don't think I would add the canned chipotle chile next time. I'm not sure that flavor was right for where I wanted to go with the soup.</p>
<p>Also, I might only use half of a chile de Ã¡rbol, since it came out pretty spicy and Darcy can't handle the heat.</p>
