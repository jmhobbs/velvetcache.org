<p>This year I decided to pull a tiny April fools joke.  I decided this at four in the afternoon, on the day of, so I didn't have time to prepare.</p>
<p>I cashed in on <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2013/03/i-live-in-omaha-creator-john-henry-mller-to-move-to-california" target="_blank">John Henry MÃ¼ller's recent departure from the Omaha area</a> to pretend I was leaving too.</p>
<p>I quickly threw up a page on my blog that would redirect to a Rick Roll, then I realized that various Twitter clients follow HTTP redirects and unwrap links to get the "real" URL and page title.  I've been <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2013/04/01/goodbye-omaha/april-fools-qr-roll.jpg" target="_blank">burned by that before</a>, so I changed my tactic slightly to move the redirect into JavaScript.  That let me put a sliver of believable content onto the page so that Facebook shares would work too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2013/04/01/goodbye-omaha/april-fools.jpg" alt="The redirect page." /></p>
<p>Finally, I tweeted it out, and started trapping suckers!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2013/04/01/goodbye-omaha/april-fools-tweet.jpg" alt="The Tweet." /></p>

<p>I didn't get Google Analytics on immediately, so I might have missed some folks, but I got 30 uniques on it that day from Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>Not bad at all. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0#t=0m43s" target="_blank">SPN even wrote about it!</a></p>
