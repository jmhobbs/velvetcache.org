title: Delayed Queues for RQ

<p>I really like <a href="http://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">RQ</a>. It's got a sensible API and it's built for Python, something I can't say about Resque, <a href="https://github.com/binarydud/pyres" target="_blank">pyres</a> is fine, but it's not the same.</p>
<p>My one beef with RQ is that I can't delay a job for an arbitrary amount of time. You queue it up and it runs.  To get around that, I built a simple delayed queue system for RQ, using the same redis backend.</p>
<p>My delayed queues leverage sorted sets to store and select jobs.  We put the job in with it's earliest run timestamp as the score, then we have a cron job or daemon that pulls them out when they are ready and pushes them over to RQ. Simple enough!</p>
<p>Here's the really relevant code, everything else is trimming.</p>
<p><strong>Delaying Jobs</strong><br/><pre lang="python">    def delay(self, queue, job, seconds, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Delay a queue job by a number of seconds.'''
        self.redis.zadd('queue:delayed', pickle.dumps({'job': job, 'queue': queue, 'args': args, 'kwargs': kwargs, 'id': uuid.uuid1().hex}), self._now() + seconds)</pre></p>
<p><strong>Waking Jobs</strong><br><pre lang="python">    def enqueue_delayed_jobs(self, now=None):
        '''Enqueue and clear out ready delayed jobs.'''
        if not now:
            now = self._now()
 
        jobs = self.redis.zrangebyscore('queue:delayed', 0, now)
 
        for pickled_job in jobs:
            job = pickle.loads(pickled_job)
            Queue(job['queue'], connection=self.redis).enqueue(job['job'], *job['args'], **job['kwargs'])
            self.redis.zrem('queue:delayed', pickled_job)
 
        return len(jobs)</pre></p>
<p>You can run this at a granularity as low as one second the way it is written, and I'm sure you could go tighter if you wanted.  We run it at a minute granularity, since our jobs are not highly time sensitive.</p>
<p>And because redis is atomic, you can run enqueue daemons/cron jobs on multiple machines, and everything should work fine, which is great for availability.</p>
