<p>I did some tinkering with an Exim server today, and it's been probably a year at least since I las touched one.  Found an invaluable cheat sheet at <a href="http://bradthemad.org/tech/notes/exim_cheatsheet.php" target="_blank">http://bradthemad.org/tech/notes/exim_cheatsheet.php</a> but it's not terribly printer friendly.</p>
<p>I knocked up a more printable one for myself with Abiword, hope it can help you too.</p>
