<div class="update"><p><b>Update: 2010-01-14</b><br/>It looks like my problems are more commons than not. The "fix" as it stands is to remove the tidy references from your RssModel.php.  Here's the bug on Google Code <a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/issues/detail?id=1#c6" target"_blank">http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/issues/detail?id=1#c6</a></p></div><p>I read <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2010/01/make-your-own-lifestream-with-open-source-software.ars" target="_blank">an article on ars</a> today that is about lifestream app <a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/" target="_blank">Storytlr</a> which is now open source.</p><p>I've seen this sort of thing before, and wanted to put one together eventually, so today I bit the bullet and just did it. It was super easy, and Storytlr is a nice piece of software.</p><p>I hit a few bumps (for instance, the RSS feed for this site isn't importing yet) but in general it pulls, stores and presents my feeds in a clean and readable fashion.</p><p>I'm under no illusion that anyone will really ever visit <a href="http://lifestream.velvetcache.org/" target="_blank">http://lifestream.velvetcache.org/</a>, but it makes me happy and it adds another bit of knowledge and experience to the corral.</p>
