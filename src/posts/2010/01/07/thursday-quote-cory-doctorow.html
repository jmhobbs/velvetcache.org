<p><blockquote>"All creative endeavor begins with just fooling around,  not doing much of anything,  just noodling and letting the different parts of your mind talk to each other. Science and art and invention spring forth when we do the unexpected and so coax our brains into letting some imaginative combinations of ideas and concepts jangle together."</blockquote></p><p style="text-align: right;"><b>- Cory Doctorow, <i>Too Much Time On My Hands</i> 2009</b></p>
