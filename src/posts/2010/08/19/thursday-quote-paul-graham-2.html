<p><blockquote>"Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's 'worth?' The only way you're ever going to extract any value from it is to use it."</blockquote></p><p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold;">- Paul Graham<br/><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html" target="_blank">Stuff</a></p>
