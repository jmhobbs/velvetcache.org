<p>Six months ago I wrote a little PHP framework as an exercise.  I'd been down this path before with the now abandoned Xoket - but this time I decided to go small, and throw away.</p>
<p>Hence <a href="https://github.com/jmhobbs/Skunk" target="_blank">Skunk</a> was born.</p>
<p>Skunk is a single file, very lightweight API.  Really, it's just a borrowed router with some sugar wrapped around it.</p>
<p>I was after a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> or <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/" target="_blank">Bottle</a> feel, and I think I got something rather nice out of it.</p>
<p>Skunk uses anonymous functions extensively, so use PHP 5.3+ to save yourself the pain of <a href="http://php.net/create_function" target="_blank"><tt>create_function</tt></a>.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here is a super simple Skunk application:</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="1">// Initialize
$s = new Skunk();

// Add a route
$s->get(
  '/hi(/<name>)',
  function ( &$s, $name = null ) {
    $s->body = 'Hello' . ( ( is_null( $name ) ) ? '' : " $name" ) . '!';
  }
);

// Run it!
$s->run();</pre></p>
<p>Let's tear that apart.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="2">$s = new Skunk();</pre></p>
<p>Everything in Skunk revolves around the <tt>Skunk</tt> object, so we need to set one up.</p><p>While it is possible to have multiple <tt>Skunk</tt> objects, there really isn't a good use case I can think of.  But we won't restrict your cleverness with a singleton.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="5">$s->get(</pre></p>
<p>The two most important functions for Skunk are <tt>get</tt> and <tt>post</tt>.</p>
<p>These functions take a route and a function to apply when that route is matched, in a <tt>GET</tt> request and a <tt>POST</tt> request respectively.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="6">  '/hi(/<name>)',</pre></p>
<p>In this chunk we are setting up a <tt>GET</tt> request, with the route <tt>/hi(/&lt;name&gt;)</tt>, so that will match <tt>/hi</tt>, <tt>/hi/John</tt>, etc.</p>
<p>Note the identifier <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> in the route. This named match will be captured and sent as an argument to the function.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="7">  function ( &$s, $name = null ) {
    $s->body = 'Hello' . ( ( is_null( $name ) ) ? '' : " $name" ) . '!';
  }
);</pre></p>
<p>Skunk route functions always need to take a reference to the <tt>Skunk</tt> object as their first argument. Following that are any other arguments that might be pulled from the route itself.</p>
<p>In this case we are just setting the body of the <tt>Skunk</tt> response.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="13">$s->run();</pre></p>
<p>This kicks off the request process and also renders the response.</p>
<h2>Other Tricks</h2>
<p>Skunk has some other features too.</p><p>You can raise a variety of errors inside of a request:
<pre lang="php" line="0">$s->get(
  '/error/500',
  function ( &$s ) {
    return $s->HTTP_500();
  }
);</pre></p>
<p>You can set headers:<pre lang="php" line="0">$s->get(
  '/example.json',
  function ( &$s ) {
    $s->header( 'Content-Type', 'application/json' );
    $s->body = json_encode( array( "Example" => TRUE ) );
  }
);</pre></p>
<p>There is even a little hook system, so you can do middleware-ish stuff:<pre lang="php" line="0">$s->hook(
  'send_head', 
  function ( &$s ) { 
    $s->header( 'X-Stinky-By', 'Skunk' );
  }
);</pre></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>So that is Skunk.</p>
<p>It could use some love, but it's workable.  We've run <a href="http://numberlaundry.whatcheer.com/" target="_blank">Number Laundry</a> on it with no problems for four months with no problems yet.</p>
