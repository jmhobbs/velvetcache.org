<p>I've noticed a trend in PHP code to shy away from function application and closures.  I understand to some extent. Useful, inline anonymous functions were not available until 5.3.0, which is relatively new.  And <tt><a href="http://php.net/create_function" target="_blank">create_function</a></tt> is an abomination.</p>
<p>Still, I think that PHP programmers just don't think in this mindset, but it can be very useful.</p>
<p>Here is a rather contrived example, but one I've honestly seen an analogue of before.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="1">$accumulator = array();
foreach( $this->tags->all() as $tags ) {
  $accumulator[] = htmlspecialchars( $tag->name );
}
return implode( ', ',  $accumulator );
</pre></p>
<p>Easy to understand, simple, does the job, but it is far more verbose than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Here is a version using <tt><a href="http://php.net/array_map" target="_blank">array_map</a></tt>.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="1">$tags = array_map( 'htmlspecialchars', $this->tags->all() );
return implode( ', ', $tags );</pre></p>
<p>The <tt><a href="http://php.net/array_map" target="_blank">array_map</a></tt> function is doing all the work of the loop, but you don't have to write it and you don't have to manage the accumulator.</p>
<p>Doesn't that feel better?</p>
<p>Next time you mangle an array, first think if <tt><a href="http://php.net/array_map" target="_blank">array_map</a></tt> or it's friends <tt><a href="http://php.net/array_filter" target="_blank">array_filter</a></tt> or <tt><a href="http://php.net/array_reduce" target="_blank">array_reduce</a></tt> could do it better.</p>
