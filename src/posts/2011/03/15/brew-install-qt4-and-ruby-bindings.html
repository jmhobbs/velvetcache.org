title: Brew Install Qt4 and Ruby Bindings

<p>The Ruby gem for Qt4 bindings, appropriately called <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/qtbindings" target="_blank">qtbindings</a>, do not build by default with brew installed Qt4 libs.</p>
<p>There is a quick fix, but it's hidden in the <a href="https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings/issues#issue/14" target="_blank">issues on github</a>.  Essentially you just need to symlink the brew headers to an expected location.</p>
<pre lang="bash">$ for DIR in /usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.7.1/lib/*.framework; do ln -s $DIR/Headers ${DIR%%/lib/*}/include/$(basename $DIR .framework); done</pre>
<p>After that is run, <tt>gem install qtbindings</tt> runs like a champ.</p>
