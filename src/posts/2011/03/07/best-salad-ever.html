<p>I am currently eating the best salad ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 10px;"><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2011/03/07/best-salad-ever/salad.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2011/03/07/best-salad-ever/salad.sm.jpg" alt="It's tasty." /></a><br/>Yes. It is that delicious.</p>
<p>Grilled chicken, fresh romaine and an asian sesame dressing.</p>
<p><b>The Chicken</b></p>
<p>The chicken is el-cheapo boneless skinless breasts, with a little sea salt, black pepper, onion powder and garlic salt. Grill it. Lots of garlic is important to play off of the dressing, don't skimp!</p>
<p><b>The Dressing</b></p>
<p>This one is easy, but it doesn't make much.  Double or triple it if you don't want to make it on a per salad basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp Rice Vinegar</li>
<li>1 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
<li>2 tsp Sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp Sesame Oil</li>
<li>1 tsp Ground White Sesame Seeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix it together and shake before using. I have only whole white sesame seeds, so I try to mash them a bit with a spoon first.</p>
<p>The dressing will filter to the bottom of your salad, so make sure you turn it a lot as you eat for maximum deliciousness.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
