<p>The online docs for testing and deploying your Enyo apps to the TouchPad are woefully weak.  I finally found how to get the TouchPad into developer mode, and thought I'd share.</p>
<p><ol><li>Start "Device Info"</li><li>In the menu, pick "Custom Application"</li><li>Enter "##devmode#"</li><li>Done!</li></ol></p>
<p>You'll need to do a restart before you can install any packages, or at least I did.</p>
