<p>This weekend I slapped together a little project called <a href="http://in-omaha.com/culture" target="_blank">in-omaha.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2011/06/20/in-omaha-com/in-omaha.png"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2011/06/20/in-omaha-com/in-omaha.sm.png" alt="Recursion!" /></a></p>
<p>It's essentially a little parody on the fact that people discount Omaha, especially people on the coasts.  This was born out of an NPR radio bit reporting on Saddle Creek and The Slowdown.</p>
<p>Here's the choice quote that I took offense to:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://m.npr.org/news/Business/136896920" target="_blank">"It all started with some young guys and some surprisingly good music."</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As if there is nobody in Omaha who appreciates good music, and definitely no one who can make it.</p>
<p>So if you make cool stuff, live in Omaha because it's great, and enjoy some chuckles, feel free to play with <a href="http://in-omaha.com/what-cheer" target="_blank">in-omaha.com</a>!</p>
