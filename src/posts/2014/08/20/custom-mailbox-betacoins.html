<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox</a> released their beta Mac app.  One cute thing they did, was that instead of a beta link or code, they distributed cute little animated gif coins which you could then drop into a "tin can" in the app to gain access.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2014/08/20/custom-mailbox-betacoins/coin113121.gif" alt="A betacoin" /></p>
<p>I was intrigued by the concept, so I got some used betacoins from my friends and did a little digging to figure out how they were doing it.</p>
<p>My plan was to diff the coins and see what was changed from coin to coin, but I didn't even need to do that.  A quick inspect with gifsicle revealed an obvious token in the gif comments extension block.</p>

<p>From there I checked a couple other coins to see if they had differing comments, and sure enough they did.</p>
<p>So now the question became, could I add the comment from a valid betacoin to another gif and have it still work?</p>
<p>I grabbed a lovely gif of a barfing unicorn off the web, and set to work.</p>
<pre lang="bash" line="0">jmhobbs@Cordelia:~/Desktop/betacoins âœª gifsicle unicorns_puke_rainbows_by_chronicle_vindictive-d56nvl0.gif  --no-comments -c '"F1699622-5500-4F31-B643-798427D0DBFA"' '#0' '#1-' > unicoin.gif

<p>I then downloaded the beta, crossed my fingers, and dragged the unicoin into the tin can.  I was rewarded with a tinkle of a coin dropping in, and access to the beta.</p>

<p>Turns out, Mailbox could care less what else is in your gif.  Just so long as you have a comment with a valid token, it'll use that gif and animate it prettily.</p>
<p>As an aside, the coin gif has a staggering 122 frames. 122.  Sparkles are expensive, yo.</p>
<h3>Edit (2014-08-20)</h3>
<p>I created a service for changing up your Mailbox betacoins, called <a href="http://unicoin.velvetcache.org/">Unicoin</a>.  You're welcome.</p>
