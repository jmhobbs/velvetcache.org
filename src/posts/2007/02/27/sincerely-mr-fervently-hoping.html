<p>You know what an awesome feature for <a href="http://last.fm/" target="_blank">last.fm</a> would be?  A location flag/tag thing.  I wish I could set something that would tag everything I listen to as "At Work" or "At Home" or "On iPod" (even though I don't have one).  That way I could create trends and see what I tend to listen to at work, home, doing the dishes, etc.</p>
