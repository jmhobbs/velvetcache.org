<p>I was getting a little sick of foobar2k here at work,  and installing cygwin with KDE seemed a little overkill just for Amarok.  I decided to give songbird another try.  This is my new fave music app for windows.  It has enough similarities to my beloved Amarok that it makes for a very good player.  It could use some better playlist features, maybe some smart playlists, but all in all pretty awesome.</p>
