<p>Got bored and <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2007/01/24/wordpress-more_posts-old_posts-new_posts/" target="_blank">scratched another itch</a> I've had in wordpress for a while.  I always wanted a way to list my categories on the sidebar on my terms.  The best I had found was the well written and executed <a href="http://ryowebsite.com/wp-plugins/category-visibility/" taeget="_blank">Category Visibility-RH</a> but I wanted to choose from all my categories and still limit the number listed.</p>
<p>I added a function to my wp-hacks.php and then dropped it into my sidebar.  Does the job, and could easily be edited.  I swear someday I'll learn how to make plug-ins, really.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="1">function jh_random_cats($howMany) {
    global $wpdb ;

		$query = "
			SELECT cat_ID, cat_name, category_count
			FROM $wpdb->categories
      WHERE category_count != '0'
    ";
		$categories = $wpdb->get_results($query);
		
		shuffle($categories); // Mix 'em up
		
		for($howMany; $howMany > 0; $howMany--) {
      $poppedCat = array_pop($categories);
      print '<li><a href="'.get_category_link($poppedCat->cat_ID).'">'.$poppedCat->cat_name.'</a> ('.$poppedCat->category_count.')</li>';
    }
}</pre></p>
<p> As a super-cool extra I got to use a PHP function I had never gotten to use before, let alone knew existed: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.shuffle.php" target="_blank">bool shuffle ( array &array )</a>.  It, you guessed it, shuffles up an array.</p>
