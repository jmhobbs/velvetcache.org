<p>Two big releases in just a few days! First there was <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2007/01/30/blowpass-v060-a-major-revision/" target="_blank">BlowPass 0.60</a> and now my "<a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2007/01/22/simple-bbcode-to-html-function-in-php/" target="_blank">secret</a> <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/12/20/whats-up/" target="_blank">project</a>" is unveiled!</p>
<p>I give you, <a href="http://www.ouruno.com/" target="_blank">OurUNO.com</a>! It's a semi-socially edited site for <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/" target="_blank">UNO</a> students to share reviews, news and generally help each other out.  It's a bit crippled in this first "beta" release, but I expect to get it in tip-top shape in no time as the core is very fleshed out.</p>
<p>Go take a look!</p>
