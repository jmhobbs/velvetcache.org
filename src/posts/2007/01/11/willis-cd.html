<p>The Lincoln band <a href="http://ilikewillis.com/" target="_blank">Willis?</a> that I <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/10/25/ozma-show/" target="_blank">mentioned briefly</a> in an October post is finally releasing their CD on Saturday, I might go to the show.  Check their website for details.  It's only a 6 song disc but it's good.  How would I know?  Well, you can listen to the whole thing on their website, and if you have 1337 skills you can download it to hold listen to offline. Not that I'm encouraging that or anything.</p>
