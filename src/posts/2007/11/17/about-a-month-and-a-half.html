title: About a month and a half...

<p>It's been about a month and a half since I started re-writing <a href="http://www.ouruno.com/">OurUNO</a> in a nice, intelligent, frameworked system with Smarty and I ran <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/">CLOC</a> on my source dir today.  CLOC doesn't do Smarty templates, so I ran them as HTML, close enough, right?</p>

<p>What I like is that my PHP files are ~23% empty space, and the one shell script has only 1 line of code.  Now, the PHP is <u>all</u> new as is most of the javascript and some of the TPL files.  So even saying a 60% cut on JS, CSS & TPL, thats still 3728 lines of code in the spare time from about a month and a half, so about 83 lines a day.  It's amazing what as little as 83 lines a day can do.</p>
