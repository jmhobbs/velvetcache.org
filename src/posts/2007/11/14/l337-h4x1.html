<p>You have got to love MySpace.  Their code has got to be so nasty, I mean, just the markup on a profile makes me sick to my stomach, I can't imagine the pasted together backend that would generate that mess.</p><p>When I got an event invitation I went to RSVP and had a thought.  I wondered how well they error checked their inputs.  I mean, I'm sure they strip and escape for SQL injection, but do they constrain anything?</p><p>I busted out Firebug, edited the source for the RSVP and now I'm bringing several tens of thousands of friends with me to the party.  Awesome.</p><p>Click for biggies.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2007/11/14/l337-h4x1/hecksyes1.png"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2007/11/14/l337-h4x1/hecksyes1_sm.png" /></a><br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2007/11/14/l337-h4x1/hecksyes.png"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2007/11/14/l337-h4x1/hecksyes_sm.png" /></a><br/>(Note: the 91213 didn't work, too big I bet)</p>
