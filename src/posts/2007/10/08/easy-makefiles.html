<p>Here's a handy g++ option that will let you make up accurate makefiles in a jiffy, <b><tt>-MM</tt></b>.</p>
<p><pre  lang="bash">g++ -MM *.cpp</pre></p>
Run that on your source directory and you'll get a makefile style list of includes.  If it doesn't work, make sure you add in your compile time defines (like <b><tt>-D_x86 -D_LINUX</tt></b>).  This won't actually check that you <i>need</i> the files you have included, it just makes a list of the ones you <i>have</i> included.</p><p>I like to add a sed line to make breaks between source files, like so.</p><p><pre lang="bash">g++ -MM *.cpp | sed 's/^\([a-zA-Z]\)/\n\1/'</pre></p><p>It's very literal though, so if you do <b><tt>"../StaticDevice.h"</tt></b> type includes, watch out for double entries.</p><p><pre lang="bash">$ g++ -MM -D_x86 -D_LINUX devices/*.cpp | sed 's/^\([a-zA-Z]\)/\n\1/'
