<p>I was playing with mootools today, and whilst trying to create a swapping pair of content divs, I put together a neat algorithm for handling the callbacks and getting it to do what I want.</p>
<p>I only wanted one div showing at a time, and I wanted them to swap with a function.  So I set up the following guardian variable and functions.  Check it out.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript" line="1">var loadingDiv;
var contentDiv;
var transitionState = 0;
      
window.onload = function () {
  loadingDiv = new Fx.Slide('loadingDiv', {onComplete: nextTransition});
  loadingDiv.hide();
  contentDiv = new Fx.Slide('contentDiv', {onComplete: nextTransition});
}

function swapThem() {
  if(transitionState == 0) {
    transitionState = 1;
    contentDiv.slideOut();
  }
  else {
    transitionState = 2;
    loadingDiv.slideOut();
  }
}

function nextTransition() {
  if(transitionState == 1) {
    transitionState = 3;
    loadingDiv.slideIn();
  }
  else if (transitionState == 2) {
    transitionState = 4;
    contentDiv.slideIn();
  }
  else if (transitionState == 4) {
    transitionState = 0;
  }
}</pre></p>
<p>It might be a little verbose, but it works like a charm.</p>
