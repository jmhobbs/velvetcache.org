<p>I found a handy trick for making sure things are lining up.  You can zoom in on the screen by holding the super key (windows key) and scrolling in/out with your mouse.  It gets a little fuzzy, but you can get a good view of about how many pixels off your layout is, then fix it up.</p><p>Likewise, windows has an accesibility tool that zooms nicely.  It's a lot crisper, pixelated view, but you have to open a seperate app for it.</p>
