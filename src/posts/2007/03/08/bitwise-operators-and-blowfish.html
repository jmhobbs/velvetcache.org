title: Bitwise Operators And Blowfish

<p>I wrote a while back about writing my own <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/12/07/blowpass-has-taken-over/" target="_blank">Blowfish/Twofish</a> implementation in JavaScript, but lamented that I didn't know enough about JS to pull it off.  Well, I still don't know enough about JS to do it, but it turns out I don't know enough about C++ to do it either.  Yesterday I tried writing my own blowfish encrypt, and got very stuck after my third iteration.</p>
<p>What was I missing that I needed to get it done? Bitwise operators and data type knowledge.  I spent some time today writing a few programs to test bitwise operators and try to understand whats going on.  The ones that gave me the most trouble were the shift operators.  For some reason I had it firmly in my mind that they acted like shift registers (think hardware).  I kept trying to shift one number into another bit by bit.</p>
<p>Only when I set up some runs and included a binary printout after each step did it actually click what was going on with those operators.  I felt silly.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a link to the source of my little bitwise operator (mostly shifts) example.  I didn't write that binary printer BTW.  I did, however, write that code highlighter system using <a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/" target="_blank">GeSHi</a>, which rocks.</p>
