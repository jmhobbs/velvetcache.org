<p>So my folks are out of town for a few days and when that happens I tend to get a lot less useful things done, and a lot more enjoyable things I have been waiting to do get, well, enjoyed.</p><p>One of those was an anime I got that looked good, 'Gunslinger Girl'.  It was very good. Exceptional art, good story line and extremely compelling characters.</p><p>I'm not kidding about the characters, they were amazingly deep for an anime and for only having 240 minutes to develop the 10 of them. I don't often re-watch anime, but 'Gunslinger Girl' is on my list again.</p>
