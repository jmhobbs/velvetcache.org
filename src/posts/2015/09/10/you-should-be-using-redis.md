summary: My talk covering Redis basics at HDC15
---
Today I gave a talk at [HDC15](http://www.heartlanddc.com/) entitled, _You Should Be Using Redis_

It covered all the basic data structures and many commands, as well as replication, sentinel and cluster.  I had a great time even though I was terrified.

Unfortunately, near the end of my talk Keynote froze and I lost the recording of the slideshow and audio, so I don't have that to share.

Instead, here are the slides, as well as slides+presenter notes.  Hopefully my notes don't contain anything embarrassing.
