title: A New GPG Key
type: post
---
<p>It's been 12 years since I created my first GPG key and 11 since I've created the one I actually use.  That is far too long, so I decided to create a new pair and deprecate the old.  <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=john%40velvetcache.org&op=index">In 2013 I started this process</a>, but I didn't follow through and I've since lost access to those keys.  I know where they are, but the machine died so I need to hook up it's HDD and pull the keys out.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is time for new ones, and I did some reading to get a real plan for this.  I would generate a new, strong key offline, with a subkey for each capability. The subkeys would go onto a smart card, in my case a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/#yubikey-4" target="_blank">Yubikey 4</a>.  The primary key material would go to offline backup to keep it safe.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Nothing in this post is new or novel, but rather collected from many other posts.  I've tried to link to any relevant posts below each section, and I encourage you to read these sources.  Any mistakes I've made I would be glad if you send me an email (GPG encrypted of course ;) to point it out.</p>
<h2>Yubikey Configuration</h2>
<p>After I ordered my Yubikey, I had to configure it.  The Yubikey docs expect a fair amount of knowledge before you start, but the steps are pretty simple when you understand it.  Basically, it boils down to:
<ol>
<li>Change the Admin PIN</li>
<li>Change the PIN</li>
<li>Set a Reset Code</li>
<li>Fill in optional metadata</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Plug in your card and proceed as follows:

<h2>Generating Keys</h2>
<p>Next, I created my keys. Be sure you set up a clean environment for this, ideally a random directory in <tt>/tmp</tt>, better still on a <tt>ramfs</tt> of an offline, live CD machine.  But that's a bit drastic for my use case.</p>
<p><pre>$ export GNUPGHOME="/tmp/$(pwgen 30 1)/gnupg"
$ echo $GNUPGHOME
/tmp/mah1zakioboo1Caipa3ORu5ielohga/gnupg
$ mkdir -p "$GNUPGHOME"
$ cd "$GNUPGHOME/.."
$ chmod 0700 gnupg
$ ls -l
total 0
drwx------  2 johnhobbs  wheel  64 May 30 14:23 gnupg</pre></p>

<p>You'll want a good base config file in there too.
<pre>
$ cat <<EOF > gnupg/gpg.conf
# Show long key IDs, not short: https://gwolf.org/node/4070
keyid-format 0xlong

# Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key listings

# Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory.
require-secmem
EOF
</pre></p>

<p>With the directory in place, I can create a primary key, option 4. 4096-bits is as strong as GPG allows right now, and I set it not to expire because I will be keeping offline and it should be ok to revoke manually if needed.</p>

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p>Now it's time to create subkeys.  There are four capabilities that a PGP key can have.</p>

<h4><tt>C</tt> is for Certify</h4>
<p>Your primary key will have the capability of Certification.  Certify is essentially the ability to sign other keys.  A key with Certify can be "parent" to subkeys, create new subkeys, and edit existing ones.  You also need this capability to sign another users public key.</p>

<h4><tt>S</tt> is for Sign</h4>
<p>A key with the Sign capability can sign files and messages, allowing others to verify their integrity.</p>

<h4><tt>E</tt> is for Encrypt</h4>
<p>A key with the Encrypt capability is used for encrypting files. Simple.</p>

<h4><tt>A</tt> is for Authenticate</h4>
<p>An Authentication key is generally used for SSH authentication.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Generating the subkeys is a bit tedious, but so it goes.</p>

<h2>Backups</h2>

<p>Before we do anything else, we need to back that thang up.</p>

<p>I'm choosing two methods: backup to a USB key that will live in a fire safe (who has a safety deposit box these days?), and a printed backup in case the USB key fails.  Ideally these two articles would not be co-located.</p>
<p>First we export the keys and move them to the USB stick.  The <tt>export-secret-subkeys</tt> output is less important than the <tt>export-secret-key</tt> output as it doesn't contain a viable certification key, but would be useful as a "middle tier" of backup that wouldn't expose your primary key to risk.</p>

<p>Now, we could take these ascii armored keys and just print them, but that's a lot of bytes to pray for OCR to recognize.  Instead, we can use a piece of software called Paperkey which strips out everything but the most secret parts of the key and gives you something much shorter to type in.</p>
<p><pre> 
$ gpg --export-secret-key | paperkey --output 0xCF469E79A0A20E10.master.paper

# Base16 data extracted Wed May 30 14:53:56 2018
# Created with paperkey 1.5 by David Shaw
#
# File format:
# a) 1 octet:  Version of the paperkey format (currently 0).
# b) 1 octet:  OpenPGP key or subkey version (currently 4)
# c) n octets: Key fingerprint (20 octets for a version 4 key or subkey)
# d) 2 octets: 16-bit big endian length of the following secret data
# e) n octets: Secret data: a partial OpenPGP secret key or subkey packet as
#              specified in RFC 4880, starting with the string-to-key usage
#              octet and continuing until the end of the packet.
# Repeat fields b through e as needed to cover all subkeys.
#
# To recover a secret key without using the paperkey program, use the
# key fingerprint to match an existing public key packet with the
# corresponding secret data from the paper key.  Next, append this secret
# data to the public key packet.  Finally, switch the public key packet tag
# from 6 to 5 (14 to 7 for subkeys).  This will recreate the original secret
# key or secret subkey packet.  Repeat as needed for all public key or subkey
# packets in the public key.  All other packets (user IDs, signatures, etc.)
# may simply be copied from the public key.
#
# Each base16 line ends with a CRC-24 of that line.
# The entire block of data ends with a CRC-24 of the entire block of data.

<h2>The certificate revoke you, secret key!</h2>
<p>While not required, we can generate a revocation certificate while we still have the primary key on this machine.</p>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 0
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
>
Reason for revocation: No reason specified
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) y
ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!</pre></p>
<p>Throw that onto your backup drive too while you're at it.</p>

<h2>To The Smart Card Robin!</h2>

<p>Moving the keys onto a smart card helps protect them.  They won't exist on your filesystem anymore, only on the card.  That means they can't be read out and stolen by a malicious process, but you can still use them by providing your smart card pin and key password.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is a one way trip.  Make sure your backups are really, truly in place. We want to move our Signing, Encryption and Authentication keys onto the card.  The Certification key we will only store offline, as mentioned before.</p>

<h2>Fin!</h2>

<p>That's it.  There is, of course, more to do, like setting up <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/Git_signing.html">git signing</a>, <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/SSH_authentication/">SSH access</a>, etc.  But the new keypair is created, and it's on the Yubikey, so that's all for now.</p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0; border-top: 4px solid black; background: none;"/>

<h2>Update: Git Signing</h2>

<p>Turns out git signing is a cinch.  Just throw a couple items into your git config and it's automatic and transparent.</p>

<p><pre>
[user]
	signingKey = 0xF79C72E6EDC70E38
[commit]
	gpgSign = true
[log]
	showSignature = true
[merge]
	verifySignatures = true
</pre></p>

<h4><tt>user.signingKey</tt></h4>
<p>Tells git which key to use for signing, unset it just uses the default key.</p>

<h4><tt>commit.gpgSign</tt></h4>
<p>Makes it sign all commits by default, instead of passing <tt>-S</tt> to every <tt>git commit</tt>.</p>

<h4><tt>log.showSignature</tt></h4>
<p>By default, git won't show you if a commit is GPG signed.  You can see it with <tt>gpg log --show-signature</tt>, or you can set it as default with this config option.</p>
<p>It makes signed commits much chunkier, so be aware of the reduced screen real estate.

<h4><tt>merge.verifySignatures</tt></h4>
<p>This is the only one I am <em>not</em> setting by default.  If you have it enabled, all merges that include unsigned commits will be rejected.  This really only works if everyone in your organization is signing all their commits.</p>

<h2>Update: One-Touch Actions</h2>

<p>By default, with the smart card in, GPG will happily sign and decrypt things after you enter your PIN the first time, with no further interaction from you.  The Yubikey offers a mode where these actions require a touch on the key to complete, which I like because it makes the action more explicit without requiring me to remove the key between operations.</p>

<p>To enable this, you need a special script, `yubitouch.sh`.  To make it work with my GPG Tools install, I had to hard code the path to `gpg-connect-agent` (`/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg-connect-agent`) and my admin PIN, since pinentry wasn't working and I didn't want it in my bash history.</p>

<p><pre>$ ./yubitouch.sh sig on
All done!
$ ./yubitouch.sh aut on
All done!
$ ./yubitouch.sh dec on
All done!</pre></p>

<p>Now, when GPG needs to sign something, my Yubikey flashes at me until I touch it and give my permission.  Neat.</p>
