title: Addressing Nested Dictionaries in Python

<p>I think that post title is right.  Essentially I mean dynamically accessing attributes from nested dictionaries or tuples.</p>
<p>Let's say you've got a JSON response like this:</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript">{
  "error": false,
  "body": {
    "name": "John",
    "job": {
      "company": "What Cheer",
      "position": "Developer"
    }
  }
}</pre></p>
<p>The JSON module would convert that into nested dictionaries, like this:</p>
<p><pre lang="python">>>> print usr
{u'body': {u'job': {u'position': u'Developer', u'company': u'What Cheer'}, u'name': u'John'}, u'error': False}</pre></p>
<p>In my case, I was trying to provide a runtime specified format string which could use any of the values at any depth.</p>
<p>There isn't (to my knowledge) an easy way to address into a deep structure with a single string.  I considered value based format strings (<tt>'%(name)s'</tt> but there is no way to descend from there either.</p>
<p>My solution was to use a dot notation and evaluate it for field values.</p>
<p>This requires a strict policy not to use dots in your keys, but that is not an issue for my use case.</p>
<p>Here is my code for the dot notation:</p>
<p><pre lang="python">def getByDotNotation( obj, ref ):
  val = obj
  for key in ref.split( '.' ):
    val = val[key]
  return val</pre></p>
<p>And here it is in use against the object above:</p>
<p><pre lang="python">>>> getByDotNotation( usr, 'body.name' )
u'John'
>>> getByDotNotation( usr, 'body.job.position' )
u'Developer'
>>> getByDotNotation( usr, 'error' )
False
>>> </pre></p>
<p>The next (optional) step would be to create a wrapper object.</p>
<p><pre lang="python">class DotAccessibleDict ( object ):
  def __init__ ( self, data ):
    self._data = data

  def __getitem__ ( self, name ):
    val = self._data
    for key in name.split( '.' ):
      val = val[key]
    return val</pre><p>
<p>Which we can then use like so:</p>
<p><pre lang="python">>>> wrapped = DotAccessibleDict( usr )
>>> wrapped['body.name']
u'John'
>>> wrapped['body.job.position']
u'Developer'
>>> wrapped['error']
False
>>> wrapped['nope']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<input>", line 7, in __getitem__
KeyError: 'nope'
>>> </pre></p>
<p>While this is just sugar, it does look nice doesn't it?  To be complete you would want to implement the <a href="http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html#sequence" target="_blank">other sequence methods</a> such as <tt>__setitem__</tt></p>
<p>So that's my fix - what's yours?</p>
