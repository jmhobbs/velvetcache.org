<p>This afternoon I wanted to make up some quick lunch, and use up some leftovers we had in the fridge.</p>
<p>Finding some rice, a half pound of tofu, celery and some green onions, I decided to make some fried rice.</p>
<p>Instead of some soy and sesame, I thought I would try making it with curry powder instead.</p>

<p>This turned out great, so I thought I would share.  Tweak the recipe to what you have in your fridge.</p>
<p><ul><li>Yellow curry powder</li><li>1/2 lb tofu</li><li>Vegetable/Canola oil</li><li>2 cups rice (day old or more)</li><li>3-4 Green onions</li><li>1-2 Celery ribs</li><li>Raw, unsalted cashews</li></ul></p>
<p>Heat up a couple tablespoons of your oil over medium-high heat. Add two teaspoons to the oil while it's heating and stir it in. Use as little oil as you think you can get away with, we want to crisp up the tofu but not have greasy rice.</p>
<p>Cut your tofu into 1/2" thick slabs and dry well, then cut again into 1/2" cubes.  Toss these in and stir to coat on all sides with the curry powder oil.</p>
<p>Let the tofu brown for a few minutes, then cut the green onions into about inch long strips and add those along with a handful of the cashews if you have them.</p>
<p>Cook and stir until the green onions start to wilt, then add and break up the rice. Two cups is a rough amount, add more or less depending on what looks right to you.</p>
<p>Give it a taste, and optionally add some more curry powder, about a teaspoon, and stir in to distribute it evenly over the rice.</p>
<p>Add the celery, cut into short 1/2" pieces (or smaller if you like) and stir it up, then cook until the celery gets bright green and soft.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
