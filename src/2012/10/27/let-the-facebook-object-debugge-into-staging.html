<p>One often important, and often overlooked aspect of modern web development is <a href="http://ogp.me/" target="_blank">Open Graph</a> tags.  You know, those meta tags with weird attributes that break your page validation?  That's a whole other topic though.</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug" target="_blank">Facebook Object Debugger</a>, and giving it access to an HTTP Auth protected environment, such as a staging or pre-launch production site. This is Apache specific, so nginx fans will have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Assume you have this setup in your Apache config or htaccess;
<pre lang="text" line="0">AuthUserFile /var/www/staging/.htpasswd
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Secure Area"
Require valid-user</pre></p>
<p>The easiest way that I've found to make this work is to accept based on user agent.  I originally tried allowing it based on IP address, but the debugger uses many IP addresses, and after I had added a half dozen I gave up and switched to user agent.</p>
<p>Be aware, that because of this, it's quite easy for someone to fake their UA and gain access, so I recommend only using this code while you actively use the debugger, and turning it off afterwards.  This also prevents leaks if someone pastes the URL into an actual Facebook comment.</p>
<p><pre lang="text" line="0">AuthUserFile /var/www/staging/.htpasswd
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Secure Area"
Require valid-user

# Allow from Facebook
SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent facebookexternalhit.* facebook
Order allow,deny
Allow from env=facebook
Satisfy Any</pre></p>

<p>Pretty easy!</p>
