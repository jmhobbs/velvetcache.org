title: Impromptu logging from a socket.io connection
type: post
---
<p>I recently participated in a live streamed event that provided a "watching now" counter usin socket.io. Basically it was a super simple node.js script which incremented or decremented a variable when users joined and left the channel, and broadcasted the count to it's subscribers.  What I didn't realize until right before the event that we might want to have a record for users on page at a given point in the broadcast.  With so little time before the broadcast, I didn't want to tinker with the server and break it, so I did the next best thing, I logged from the subscriber side.</p>
<p>I put up a quick PHP script on my laptop that allowed cross-domain access from the origin server and logged the incoming counter.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="1">
<?php
  header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS');
  header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');
  header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com');
  header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, *');
  file_put_contents('log.txt', time() . ', ' . $_REQUEST['count'] . "\n", FILE_APPEND);</pre></p>
<p>Then, in Chrome's JavaScript console, I just hooked updates from socket.io into an XHR to provide the values to my PHP.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript" line="0">socket.on('update', function ( data ) { $.get('http://localhost/logger.php', { count: data.count } ); } );</pre></p>
<p>It worked like a charm, I didn't have to mess with the server at a crucial point, and we got the data we needed.</p>
