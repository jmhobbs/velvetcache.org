title: Sneaker-netting Huge Files with split and cat
type: post
---
<p>Big files happen, and sometimes they need to be moved.</p>
<p>I've found that moving big files between local computers is often fastest with a USB drive and my shoes, especially since I don't really have access to a wired network usually.</p>
<p>But sometimes, files are just too big for your thumb drive. Some of us don't carry huge drives around, I usually only have a spare 2GB on me.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a 4.4GB ZIP file (don't ask, just suppose).  I've only got a 2GB (1.9GB usable) thumb drive on me, but I need to move it over to another machine and I don't have all day.</p>
<p>In the past I've use <tt>dd</tt> tricks, but I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
<p>Enter <tt>split</tt> and <tt>cat</tt>. <tt>cat</tt> concatenates files, and it's cousin <tt>split</tt>, well, splits them.</p>
<p>Perfect! Just what I needed! I'll split my file into chunks with <tt>split</tt>, sneaker it over the other machine and <tt>cat</tt> it all back together.</p>
