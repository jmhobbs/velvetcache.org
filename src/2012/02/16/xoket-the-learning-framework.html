title: 'Xoket: The Learning Framework'
type: post
---
<p>If you are new to it, frameworks are confusing, and just <b>hard</b>.  Books and tutorials help, but there's still a lot of "magic" going on in the background.  This is good if you can treat it as a black box, but it's better if you can find out what's going on in there.</p>
<p>To this end, I have decided to write a framework, piece by piece, from scratch.</p>
<p>This framework does not have delusions of grandeur.  I don't expect anyone to actually use it in production, that is not what it's for.</p>
<p>This framework is about learning and sharing.  I'm going to blog my way through every component, as I build it, and keep a full history in github.  I'm not going to lie, there will be mis-steps, but you'll be able to see it all evolve commit by commit.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Principles are a good place to start - here are some for Xoket <em>(zah-ket)</em></p>
<h3>1. Documentation</h3>
<p>As stated above, documentation is essential. PHPDoc formatting will be used.</p>
<h3>2. MVC</h3>
<p>Xoket will be a single request, MVC framework.  HMVC is popular, but in the interest of complexity, we will not be implementing multiple request.</p>
<h3>3. Explicit is better than Implicit</h3>
<p>Taking a queue from <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank">The Zen of Python</a> I will try to write explicitly, instead of using implicit magic. Unusual technique will be commented and discussed.</p>
<h3>4. Modular</h3>
<p>As much functionality that can be moved out of the core, should be kept out of the core. Auto-loading will be <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md" target="_blank">PSR-0</a> compatible, but also include some cascading functionality similar to <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/3.0/guide/kohana/files" target="_blank">Kohana</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Modern</h3>
<p>Xoket will be designed for PHP 5.3 and higher. If you aren't running modern PHP you should, there really isn't a good excuse.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>That's the outline of Xoket - my next post will be about the early implementation of, well, whatever I decide to write first.</p>
