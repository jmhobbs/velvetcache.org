<div class="update"><p><b>2010-12-27</b><br/>So, something really simple was staring me in the face and I ignored it.  CSS transforms.  I've switched to that, but I still like the webkit stuff, it was fun to glue together.</p></div><p>This Sunday I tinkered for a few hours on a little project.  I registered the Unicode version of my domain name, upside down (ÇÉ¥É”ÉÉ”Ê‡ÇÊŒlÇÊŒ)  This was inspired by the post from <a href="http://iwantmyname.com/the-sad-story-of-the-snowman" target="_blank">The Sad Story Of The Unicode Snowman: â˜â†’â„â†’â˜ƒâ†’â˜€â†’â˜ºâ†’â˜‚â†’â˜¹â†’âœ.ws</a> as posted on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2035926" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>It had to be a .com, but I bought it from DreamHost anyway.</p>
<p>Next I thought about <a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html" target="_blank">Upside-Down-Ternet</a> from a while back, but I wanted mine to be all upside down.</p>
<p>So, I glued together some stuff and I now have an upside down copy of this website at that domain.  It's a bit rough right now, I'm rendering it in Webkit with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/" target="_blank">wkhtmltopdf</a> and then rotating and slicing with <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>, all glued together with PHP and some shell scripting.</p><p>I want it to be an actual HTML copy eventually, but if you visit my domain it should show you anything on www.velvetcache.org.  You can even view this post: <a href="http://www.ÇÉ¥É”ÉÉ”Ê‡ÇÊŒlÇÊŒ.com/2010/12/27/www-ÇÉ¥É”ÉÉ”Ê‡ÇÊŒlÇÊŒ-com">http://www.ÇÉ¥É”ÉÉ”Ê‡ÇÊŒlÇÊŒ.com/2010/12/27/www-ÇÉ¥É”ÉÉ”Ê‡ÇÊŒlÇÊŒ-com</a></p>
<p>I added a little link to all of my pages to let you flip them in place, it's the very bottom right and it says "[dÄ±lÉŸ]".  It's my newest little easter egg, like the <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/05/27/konami-code-unicorn-blitz" target="_blank">Konami Code</a>.</p>
