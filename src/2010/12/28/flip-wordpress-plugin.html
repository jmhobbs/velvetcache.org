<p>So I took a few minutes and slapped together a plugin for WordPress that lets you "flip" your website upside down.  I basically just packaged up the code from the <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/12/27/www-%c7%9d%c9%a5%c9%94%c9%90%c9%94%ca%87%c7%9d%ca%8cl%c7%9d%ca%8c-com">last post.</a></p>
<p>Grab a copy here: <a href="https://github.com/jmhobbs/Flip" target="_blank">https://github.com/jmhobbs/Flip</a>.  It works for me in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
