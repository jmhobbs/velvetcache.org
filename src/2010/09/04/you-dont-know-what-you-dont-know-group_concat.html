title: You Don't Know What You Don't Know - GROUP_CONCAT
type: post
---
<p>I've been trying to get <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/" target="_blank">Sphinx</a> search running at work and I've been stymied by needing to get data out of a many-to-many table.  This has to be a possibility, why can't I find a reference to it, and  I'm not much of a DBA to begin with.</p>
<p>Turns out it's not that hard, it just takes an SQL construct that I'd never seen before, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-functions.html#function_group-concat" target="_blank">GROUP_CONCAT</a>.  Once you have that building block, it becomes pretty easy, but without it, it seemed insurmountable.</p>
<p><pre lang="sql" line="1">SELECT
    posts.id, 
    posts.title, 
    posts.body, 
    GROUP_CONCAT( tag.name SEPARATOR ', ' ) AS tags
FROM posts
LEFT OUTER JOIN posts.id = post_tags.post_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN post_tags.tag_id = tags.id
GROUP BY posts.id;</pre></p>
<p>This highlights a flaw in my autodidact education.  If I just glom together from the internet, and something isn't mentioned (or is only mentioned tangentially) then I don't even know I don't know something.  Interesting problem to have to work around.</p>
