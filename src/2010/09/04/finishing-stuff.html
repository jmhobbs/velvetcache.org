<p>I've been reading Scott Belsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184312X?ie=UTF8&tag=o053-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=159184312X">Making Ideas Happen: Overcoming the Obstacles Between Vision and Reality</a> and looking at my Github account.</p><p>I start <u>so much stuff</u> and most of it just wastes away, partially complete.  I think this is the same reason I haven't shipped any web apps, or anything beyond basic consulting work really.</p><p>No more.  I've started making lists, letting things steep and trying to only do a few things at a time, and do them until they are done.</p><p>And it's working, sort of.  Recently I've started <em>and</em> completed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/MarkedUp" target="_blank">MarkedUp</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mklst.com/" target="_blank">MkLst</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/No-PEAR-Crypt_Blowfish" target="_blank">No PEAR Crypt_Blowfish</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/PanoramAh" target="_blank">PanoramAh</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/userping-for-wordpress" target="_blank">UserPing for WordPress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jmhobbs.github.com/Konami-Unicorn-Blitz/" target="_blank">Konami Unicorn Blitz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, none of these are huge projects, but they are done.</p>
<p>Totally done, feature complete as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>That feels good. You should try it if you don't already.</p>
