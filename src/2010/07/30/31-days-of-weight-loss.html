title: 31 Days of Weight Loss
type: post
---
<p>Thirty-one days ago I decided to lose some weight.</p>
<p>I haven't made any huge changes in my diet, just cutting down on how much I eat, when I eat it and what it is.  Soda is nearly gone, as are sweet coffee drinks.  I no longer graze, and if I do need a snack I lean towards something healthier.  For example I started keeping trail mix at work instead of hitting up the vending machine for a candy bar or something.</p>
<p>A month later I'm down about six pounds.  It's not a super smooth curve, but it's gradual and it's easy.  I'll keep on trucking, and I need to add some exercise in there, so we'll see what the next few months hold.</p>
