<p>I've been meaning to check out the <a href="http://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy" target="_blank">Tweepy</a> for a while and got around to it today.  It's a Python library for interacting with Twitter.  The feature I'm most interested in is the streaming API support, which isn't advertised much by Tweepy but seems pretty solid.</p>
<p>Tweepy has pretty good <a href="http://joshthecoder.github.com/tweepy/docs/index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>, and the code is terse and readable, but what I found most useful was the examples repository, which had the only <a href="http://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy-examples/blob/master/streamwatcher.py" target="_blank">example of streaming with Tweepy</a> that I could find in the official documentation.</p>
<p>It's really straightforward.  Implement a <tt>tweepy.streaming.StreamListener</tt> to consume data, set up a <tt>tweepy.streaming.Stream</tt> with that listener, then pull the trigger on the streaming function you want to use.</p>
<p>Here's a quick example I set up to track the filter keyword "omaha".</p>
<p><pre lang="python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from tweepy.streaming import StreamListener, Stream

class Listener ( StreamListener ):
  def on_status( self, status ):
    print '-' * 20
    print status.text
    return

if __name__ == "__main__":

  USERNAME = "YourUsernameHere"
  PASSWORD = "YourPasswordHere"

  listener = Listener()
  stream = Stream(
    USERNAME,
    PASSWORD,
    listener
  );

  stream.filter( track=( "omaha", ) )</pre></p>
