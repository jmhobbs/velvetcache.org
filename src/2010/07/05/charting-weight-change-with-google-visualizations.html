title: Charting Weight Change With Google Visualizations

<p>I started trying to lose weight a while back, since we both know I'm a bit heavy and sitting in front of a computer isn't going to lose the weight for me.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's important that I incorporate technology into my weight loss somehow, right?  So I decided to give the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/charttools/index.html" target="_blank">Google Visualizations API</a> a spin.</p>
<p>I worked up a quick data format and a method to pop the data out. Nothing fancy, just a fixed width flat file. This doesn't deserve a database.</p>
<p><pre lang="text" line="1">2010-06-30 235.4
2010-06-29 236.8</pre></p>
<p>Easy to read, easy to edit, and easy to consume.  Every morning I just hop on the server, add the day's weight and log off.</p>
<p><pre lang="php" line="1"><?php
  // Get the max days back we want to look.
  $max_days = 7;
  if( isset( $_REQUEST['days'] ) and ! empty( $_REQUEST['days'] ) )
    $max_days = intval( $_REQUEST['days'] );

  $i = 0;
  $lines = array();

  $fh = fopen( 'data.txt', 'r' );
  while( ! feof( $fh ) and ++$i <= $max_days ) {
    $line = fgets( $fh );
    if( empty( $line ) ) { continue; }
    array_unshift( $lines, $line );
  }
  fclose( $fh );</pre></p>
<p>Now I just needed to represent it.  The API is very object oriented and easy to work with.  I wish there was a less verbose way of presenting the data, but you can't have everything.</p><p>Actually, there may be a better way, I just didn't come across it while speed reading the docs.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript" line="1">function drawChart() {
  var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
  data.addColumn( 'string', 'Date' );
  data.addColumn( 'number', 'Weight' );

  data.addRows( <?php echo count( $lines ); ?> );
        
  <?php
    $i = 0;
    foreach( $lines as $line ):
  ?>
  data.setValue( 
    <?php echo $i; ?>, 
    0,
    '<?php echo substr( $line, 0, 10 ); ?>'
  );

  data.setValue(
    <?php echo $i; ?>,
    1,
    <?php echo floatval( substr( $line, 11 ) ); ?>
  );
  <?php
    ++$i;
    endforeach;
  ?>
    
  var chart_div = document.getElementById( 'chart_div' );
  var chart = new google.visualization.LineChart( chart_div );
  chart.draw(
    data,
    {
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
      title: 'Weight Over Time'
    }
  );
}</pre></p>
<p>And there you have it, fancy charting in no time.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2010/07/05/charting-weight-change-with-google-visualizations/weight.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2010/07/05/charting-weight-change-with-google-visualizations/weight.sm.png" alt="Example Chart" /></a></p><p>See it in action at <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/weight.php" target="_blank">http://static.velvetcache.org/weight.php</a></p><p>Get the full source at <a href="http://gist.github.com/459148" target="_blank">http://gist.github.com/459148</a>.</p>
