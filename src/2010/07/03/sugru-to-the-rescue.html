<p>I finally got a hold of some <a href="http://sugru.com/" target="_blank">Sugru</a> a few days ago.  I had pre-ordered a sample pack (12 small sachets) and it arrived at last.</p><p>First off, when they say that a sachet is small, they mean it.  However, this stuff goes a long way.</p>

<p>My first fix was my beloved flip flops.  I've had these for 5+ years and they are the most comfortable things ever. Darcy would tell you that I only hang on to them because she hates them BUT THATS A LIE! <span style="font-size: 8px;">(mostly)</span></p>

<p>These sandals had major issues.  Before I repaired them there was a rip all the way through (depth wise) and almost all the way across (width wise).  Previously I had closed that gap with long nails, which worked for most of a summer, but they were not a long term solution.</p>

<p>But Sugru was just the ticket, it worked great.  I followed the instructions and washed up then opened a packet and got to work.  I found that it stuck to me more than the shoe in my case, but with some push and quick pull-back I managed to get it where I wanted it.</p><p>I used two sachets on this, but looking back I could have done the job with one.  The first packet I put up top and I rushed a bit and got sloppy.  Later I put the bottom packet on and I think that's what actually did the job.</p>

<p>All in all a nice experience.  My only issue with Sugru is that is stained my hands for a while, but that's a pretty minor complaint.  My sandal is comfy, solid and ready for years more action.</p>
