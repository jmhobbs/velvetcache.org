<div class="update"><p><b>Update 2010-01-05</b><br/>I tried using the VNC mode and it choked and died, making me re-download a bunch of stuff when I ran it in text mode. Just an FYI, not saying it will happen to you, but warning that it might.  Honestly, I didn't see much difference running in VNC vs. Text, you get the same options.</p></div>
<p>It appears that over the internet installation is no longer a recommended way to get CentOS.  However, I can not for the life of me convince my DVD burner to write the CentOS 5.4 ISO.  I did however have a live CD. So I found a nice guide for <a href="http://www.chrisgountanis.com/technical/45-centos-netinstall.html" target="_blank">5.3 NetInstall</a> and adapted it, very very little has changed.</a></p><p>The mirror list is <a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=30" target="_blank">here</a> and it just so happens that UNL is a full mirror. So, thanks UNL!</p>
