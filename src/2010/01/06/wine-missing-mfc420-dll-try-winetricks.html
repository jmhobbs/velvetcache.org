title: Wine Missing MFC420.DLL? Try winetricks.
type: post
---
<p>I've been firing up my old copies of Sim Tower and Yoot Tower to, um, research for <a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/pyTower" target="_blank">pyTower</a>.  It's been a while since I used wine, so when Yoot Tower borked because of a missing dll ( MFC420.DLL, natch ) I hit the Google and found this great little ditty: <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks" target="_blank">winetricks</a>. It's a little script that will install all kinds of DLL's on demand from all over the net.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2010/01/06/wine-missing-mfc420-dll-try-winetricks/winetricks.png" alt="It even has a GUI!" /><br/><b>It even has a GUI!</b></p><p>It did the trick really fast, so I'd recommend it net time you get stuck.</p>
