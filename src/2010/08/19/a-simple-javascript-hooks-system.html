title: A Simple JavaScript Hooks System
type: post
---
<p>I was looking to add some more extensibility to a project this week and I couldn't find a hook system for JavaScript.  I wanted something similar to the PHP <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Hooks" target="_blank">hook system in MediaWiki</a>, but Google just wasn't much help.</p>
<p>I'm sure there is something out there that does what I need, but it's such a simple thing I went ahead and implemented it.</p>
<p><b>hook.js</b><br/><pre lang="javascript" line="1">var Hook = {
  hooks: [],

  register: function ( name, callback ) {
    if( 'undefined' == typeof( Hook.hooks[name] ) )
      Hook.hooks[name] = []
    Hook.hooks[name].push( callback )
  },

  call: function ( name, arguments ) {
    if( 'undefined' != typeof( Hook.hooks[name] ) )
      for( i = 0; i < Hook.hooks[name].length; ++i )
        if( true != Hook.hooks[name][i]( arguments ) ) { break; }
  }
}</pre></p>
<p>Extensions can "get in line" for a hook by calling <tt>register</tt> with the hook name and callback. <pre lang="javascript" line="1">Hook.register(
  'quit',
  function ( args ) {
    alert( 'Bye!' );
    return true;
  }
);</pre></p><p>Core code (or even other extensions actually) can call hooks by using the <tt>call</tt> method, with name and an argument array (think argv).  If a hook returns anything other than <tt>true</tt>, processing of the hook ceases. <pre lang="javascript" line="1">Hook.call( 'quit', [ 'All Done' ] );</pre></p>
<p>To do useful things you have to set up the right arguments.  Since objects are <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass" target="_blank">passed by reference</a> in JavaScript, you can manipulate anything in the argument array from inside of your hook (or even add to the array if you want).</p>
<p>Obviously this is a simplified tool.  All code is implicitly trusted, argument specification is non-existent, there is no prioritization (except for insertion order) and hooks are not guaranteed to run. But it works!</p>
<p>You can check out some basic usage code and test it out <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2010/08/19/a-simple-javascript-hooks-system/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Suggestions are welcome!</p>
