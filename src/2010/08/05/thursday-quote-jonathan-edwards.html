<p><blockquote>"It is not about solving puzzles and being the brightest kid in the class. It is about realizing that the complexity of software dwarfs even the most brilliant human; that cleverness cannot win. The only weapons we have are simplicity and convention."</blockquote></p><p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold;">- Jonathan Edwards<br/><a href="http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=422" target="_blank"><em>Mea Culpa</em></a></p>
