<p>Yesterday I was stuck at the office while Darcy got a flat replaced.  I decided to make a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> editor real quick, since I'm always using the web dingus to preview it, and that gets old.</p>
<p>I found the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/" target="_blank">python-markdown2</a> library, and then decided to try out the WebKit integration in Qt4.</p>
<p>The best word for it is painless.  Seriously, I got the <a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/MarkedUp/blob/7e7956076ab9d6c404f8fe510be0beb471c53a65/MarkedUp.py" target="_blank">first version</a> glued together in about ten minutes, including finding the markdown library and reading all the docs for QWebView.  It's a brutal hack, but it worked just fine, and only took up <b>45</b> lines of code.</p>
<p>I've since dropped in three more markup languages, as well as cleaned it up to something readable.  But I doubt I have more than a couple hours invested thus far.</p.
<p>I think this is a quintessential demonstration of the power of Python, which breaks down to three things.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Fast development</b><br/>No compile cycle, it reduces the barrier to creating a prototype.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Huge Ecosystem</b><br/>There is a library for <u>everything</u> and it's all easy to get to and use.</li>
<li><b>Good Documentation & Intuitive Behavior</b><br/>Most packages have good documentation, and those that don't still behave intuitively. Just pydoc around until you find what you need.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>MarkedUp is now feature complete, stable, and available at your local <a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/MarkedUp/tree/0.1.0" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
