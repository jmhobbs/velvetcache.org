<p>I've been struck recently about how different my quality of life is when I am consuming versus creating.</p><p>When I am creating (writing, coding, cooking, etc.) I feel vibrant and alive. When I am consuming (watching T.V., reading inane articles on the web, playing video games, etc.) I feel slow and dull. The exceptions being group consumption (video games with friends) and books (reading good, engaging content).</p><p>As a reminder to myself and perhaps to others I created <a href="http://www.consumelesscreatemore.com/" target="_blank">http://www.consumelesscreatemore.com/</a>. It's just quotes, presented in a more or less "pretty" way.  You can grab the source on <a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/consume-less-create-more" target="_blank">github</a> and add your own quotes, I'll be happy to take your act of creation and integrate it to the site.</p><p>The core point is: an act of creation, however small (a two page website for instance) is better than any amount of consumption.</p><p>Consume Less. Create More.</p>
