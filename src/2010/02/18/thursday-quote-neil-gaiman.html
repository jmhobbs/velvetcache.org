<p><blockquote>"May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself."</blockquote></p><p style="text-align: right;"><b>- Neil Gaiman</b></p>
