<p>So I learned something cool today, Psalm's 14 and 53 are <a href="http://larrycheng.com/2010/02/04/the-chapter-in-the-bible-that-appears-twice/" target="_blank">almost identical</a> (in NIV anyway).</p><p>As a service to the community, I created a patch, just in case you have Psalm 14 already, why download all of Psalm 53?</p><p>Enjoy!<pre lang="diff">--- psalm-14	2010-02-04 10:23:49.000000000 -0600

-Psalm 14
+Psalm 53

 1 The fool says in his heart,
 "There is no God."
-They are corrupt, their deeds are vile;
+They are corrupt, and their ways are vile;
 there is no one who does good.

-2 The LORD looks down from heaven
+2 God looks down from heaven
 on the sons of men
 to see if there are any who understand,
 any who seek God.

-3 All have turned aside,
+3 Everyone has turned away,
 they have together become corrupt;
 there is no one who does good,
 not even one.

-4 Will evildoers never learnâ€”
+4 Will the evildoers never learnâ€”
 those who devour my people as men eat bread
-and who do not call on the LORD?
+and who do not call on God?

-5 There they are, overwhelmed with dread,
-for God is present in the company of the righteous.
+5 There they were, overwhelmed with dread,
+where there was nothing to dread.
+God scattered the bones of those who attacked you;
+you put them to shame, for God despised them.

-6 You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor,
-but the LORD is their refuge.
-
-7 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
-When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,
+6 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
+When God restores the fortunes of his people,
 let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
