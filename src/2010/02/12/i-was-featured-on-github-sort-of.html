<p>So I logged onto <a href="http://twitter.com/jmhobbs" target="_blank">my twitter account</a> this morning to find a message from <a href="http://twitter.com/changelogshow" target="_blank">@changelogshow</a> telling me they had <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/385487416/storytlr-php-lifestreaming-for-geeks">written an article</a> about my fork of <a href="http://storytlr.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Storytlr</a>.</p>
<p>That's was pretty cool on it's own, until I realized that <a href="http://github.com/blog/591-explore-github" target="_blank">The Changelog is the source of featured repo's</a> on <a href="http://github.com/explore" target="_blank">Explore GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Awesome!  I love github. There is so much amazing software on there, and I was lucky enough to have my repo featured!</p>
<p>I didn't even develop the software, it's a fork of the Storytlr core written by <a href="http://twitter.com/eschnou" target="_blank">@eschnou</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/alardw" target="_blank">@alardw</a> (and a fine piece of software at that). I just wrote some plugins and fixed the stuff that was broken for me.</p>
<p>Even so, it felt great to be on there! This is one of the first times anyone has ever made it clear that what I was doing in the open source world was seen and dare I say it appreciated. Unspeakably cool.</p>
