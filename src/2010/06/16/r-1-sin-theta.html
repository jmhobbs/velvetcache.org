<p>And here's the lyrics.</p><p><pre lang="text">At the edge of the bell curve, I'd hoped there was one for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I knew I'd love you, statistically.

I've got your number, you've got mine, so call me baby.
We're just two big old primes, together live unfactorably.

You'll never find another like me.
I solve your equation so elegantly.

At the edge of the bell curve, I'd hoped there was one for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I knew I'd love you, statistically.

Unlike the number pi, you are so rational.
And with you, baby, I always know my set is full.

You'll never find an angle on me.
'Cause baby, oh baby, we're complimentary.

At the edge of the bell curve, I'd hoped there was one for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I knew I'd love you, statistically.

You'll never find a number like me.
And, baby this love's not imaginary.

At the edge of the bell curve, I'd hoped there was one for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I knew I'd love you, statistically.

3.141592

At the edge of the bell curve, I found you waiting for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I'll always love you, infinitely.

At the edge of the bell curve, I'd hoped there was one for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I knew I'd love you, statistically.

At the edge of the bell curve, I'd hoped there was one for me.
At the edge of the bell curve, I knew I'd love you, statistically.</pre></p>
