<p>This week <a href="http://twitter.com/sant0sk1" target="_blank">Jerod Santo</a> released a nifty little app he had written for the Mac called <a href="http://detoursapp.com/" target="_blank">Detours</a>.  It's pretty cool, it's a nice GUI where you can add routing information.  So, you can make the DNS resolver think google.com is located at 127.0.0.1.  Stuff like that.</p>
<p>I use Linux though, and I wanted some of that goodness.  Unfortunately, <a href="http://twitter.com/sant0sk1/status/29476177589" target="_blank">Jerod told me</a> that Detours uses some <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Networking/Conceptual/Open_Directory/Introduction/Introduction.html" target="_blank">OS X specific API calls</a>.  So, cool for Mac folks but lame for me.</p>
<p>That evening I set off to write a portable version of Detours by using the hosts file (<tt>/etc/hosts</tt>) on Linux.  Naturally since I'm groking a text format it's uglier, and it requires a daemon/client set up since the hosts file is write-locked for normal users.</p>
<p>But, I got one working that night and I've built it out since then.  So I present to the Linux users of the world, <a href="http://jmhobbs.github.com/detours-clone" target="_blank">Detours Clone</a>.  Lame name I know, if you have a suggestion for a better one let me know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a nice Python daemon and three Python clients (Qt4, GTK+ and a web server!).  They speak JSON over TCP sockets (bound to 127.0.0.1 of course) and work well so far.  I even wrote a few tests and a distutils installer.</p>
<p>So go check it out!</p>
