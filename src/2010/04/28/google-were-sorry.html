<p>So this is a new one. I left my laptop alone with two Gmail's and Google Reader open in Firefox.  When I came back they had locked up, as Firefox sometimes does.</p><p>I restarted Firefox (<tt>kill -9</tt> ftw!) and when I did Google had a quick humanity test for me.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2010/04/28/google-were-sorry/sorry.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2010/04/28/google-were-sorry/sorry.sm.png" alt="Sorry!" /></a></p>I assume that my Firefox was spamming them with requests while it was locked up, so this isn't "weird" per-say, just new to me. Thought I'd share!</p>
