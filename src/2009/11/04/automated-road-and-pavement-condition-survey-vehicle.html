<p>I saw this on my way to work today.  It's got lots of stuff hanging off of it, pretty cool looking.</p>

<p>I couldn't get a better shot (stupid stick shift) but there was more hardware on the front too.  I definitely saw some laser warning stickers on the bottom and the side read "Automated Road and Pavement Condition Survey", or something equivalent to that, and it had blue on white government plates.</p><p>Couldn't find much on the web, and nothing really in the US even.  Cool though.  Anyone in the know, fill me in!</p><p><ul><li><a href="http://www.dor.state.ne.us/mat-n-tests/pdfs-docs/npms.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dor.state.ne.us/mat-n-tests/pdfs-docs/npms.pdf</a></li><li><a href="http://www.roadware.com/products_services/aran/" target="_blank">http://www.roadware.com/products_services/aran/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/ete/highways/maintenance/index.cfm?override=subtopic&infoid=6586" target="_blank">http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/ete/highways/maintenance/index.cfm?override=subtopic&infoid=6586</li><li><a href="http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/PR/2005/September/248-05.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/PR/2005/September/248-05.htm</a></li></ul></p>
