<p>Introducing pyTower, a python based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTower" target="_blank">Sim Tower</a> clone.  This is a new project I started, after finding the existing clones lacking.  So far it's in a really useless stage of development, but I wanted to show if what I had done so far.</p><p>I'm building it on the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/" target="_blank">pygame library</a>, which is a low level wrapper around <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a>. I have to say, I am incredibly impressed with this library. You can get started really, really fast. Just focus on surfaces, rectangles, events and blitting. Ta-da, you have the basic tools for a game.</p><p>Anyway, the dev work is at <a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/pyTower" target="_blank">github</a> for your enjoyment.</p><p>One of the (I think) cool things I am doing is implementing the menu system in Qt4. Menu's are hard in pygame, IMHO, so I went around them. This gives it a bit of an MDI feel, but I like it so far. If things go well I might find a way to move the mini box into another window.  I think this will be beneficial long-term because I'm planning on making the technology tree really flexible and extensible.</p><p>Anyway, here are the totally not-cool looking screen shots I have so far. Art is hard.</p><p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/12/31/trying-out-pygame-pretty-cool/pt1.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/12/31/trying-out-pygame-pretty-cool/pt1.sm.png" alt="The main menu, Qt4 + pygame." /></a><br/>The main menu, Qt4 + pygame.</p><p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/12/31/trying-out-pygame-pretty-cool/pt2.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/12/31/trying-out-pygame-pretty-cool/pt2.sm.png" alt="The game space, with mini map!" /></a><br/>The game space, with mini map!</p>
