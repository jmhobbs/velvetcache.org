<div class="update"><p><b>(Update 2009-12-07)</b><br/>I fixed it to work in webkit too.</p></div>
<p>I was playing with <tt>clip</tt> and <tt>border-radius</tt> and put this little guy together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/12/07/css-heart/css_heart.png" alt="&lt;3 CSS" /></p>
<p>I haven't tested it in anything but Iceweasel 3.5.5, so your mileage may vary.  You can check it out here: <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2009/12/07/css-heart/css_heart.html">CSS Heart</a>.</p><p>This is only two <tt>divs</tt> to make the heart. Much less impressive than the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200805/css_homer_animated.html">Homer Simpson in CSS</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose I could have just used &amp;hearts; huh?</p>
