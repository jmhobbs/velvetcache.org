title: Disable Gnome Keyring for SVN
type: post
wp_id: "397"

<p>Although I am personally switching over to <a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs" target="_blank">git</a> for my projects, we still use Subversion here at work.</p>
<p>Something I've noticed recently is that SVN now stores my passwords in gnome-keyring.  This appears to be a feature in <a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2009/07/subversion-16-security-improvements.html" target="_blank">version 1.6</a> and I am running 1.6.5.  It seems from that article that it can also use KDE's Wallet system.</p>  
<p>However, I do not use Gnome, and I don't like KDE wallet.  Plus, sometimes it seemed that gnome-keyring would stick on me during a transaction.  The only way to fix it was to run another transaction (svn update usually) in another shell.</p>
<p>I finally got sick of it today and Google'd around.  Here is the fix I found, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=1065&dsMessageId=2402527&orderBy=createDate&orderType=desc" target="_blank">edit ~/.subversion/config and add one key.</a></p>

<p>Easy enough, and once I did everything was a-okay. Hope this helps someone else!</p>

ATTENTION!  Your password for authentication realm:

   <http://svn.REDACTED.com:80> Private SVN

can only be stored to disk unencrypted!  You are advised to configure
your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if
possible.  See the documentation for details.

You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value
of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in
'/home/jmhobbs/.subversion/servers'.

Store password unencrypted (yes/no)? yes
