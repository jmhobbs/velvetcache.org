My name is John Hobbs, and I do computer stuff.
I have a Bachelors in MIS from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
Currently, I help the world build better UI through testing at [Chromatic](https://chromatic.com)

In the past, I made fancy websites with [What Cheer](http://whatcheer.com/) ðŸª¦,
helped build the greatest dog social network ever, [Pack](http://packdog.com) ðŸª¦,
and made the best Wordpress hosting in the world at [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/) ðŸª¦.

To get in touch, just send me an email, [john@velvetcache.org](mailto:john@velvetcache.org)

## Buttercup Farm

My wife and I live with our kids on 11 acres just outside of Omaha.
We run a small, natural farm for food and flowers, [Buttercup Farm](https://buttercupfarmomaha.com)
