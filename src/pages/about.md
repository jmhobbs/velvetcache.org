In the past, I made fancy websites with [What Cheer](http://whatcheer.com/) ðŸª¦,
helped build the greatest dog social network ever, [Pack](http://packdog.com) ðŸª¦,
and made the best Wordpress hosting in the world at [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/) ðŸª¦.

## Uses

[What I use...](/uses/)

## Buttercup Farm

My wife and I live with our kids on 11 acres just outside of Omaha.
We run a small, natural farm for food and flowers, [Buttercup Farm](https://buttercupfarmomaha.com)

## Projects

I'm constantly working on new projects (it's a flaw) but these are some of my current ones, or ones I'm particularly fond of.

### [Cult of the Party Parrot](https://cultofthepartyparrot.com)

Cult of the Party Parrot is a site collecting and cataloging all of the party parrots we can find.

### [jsTodoTxt](https://github.com/jmhobbs/jsTodoTxt)

I'm a fan of the [todo.txt format]() and wrote a JavaScript library for handling it long ago.  Recently I've been rewriting it in TypeScript and trying to make it more reliable and extensible.

### [little machines](https://github.com/jmhobbs/little-machines)

Little machines is a collection of small language interpreters and virtual machines implemented in Go.

### [Mushroom Notes](https://mushroom-notes.com/)

I've done a lot of reading online, and in books, about mushroom cultivation.  I'm not an expert, but I am gathering all my notes here. My goal is to make it a collaborative site and a single place for proven techniques to be recorded.

### [Martha](https://github.com/jmhobbs/martha)

Martha is an all-in-one mushroom fruiting chamber automation system written in Go for the Raspberry Pi.
