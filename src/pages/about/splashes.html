<p>I've had a few mildly successful things and events on the web, so I thought I would keep track of these here.</p>

<h2>Beef Taco<br/><em style="font-size: 12px;">June 2010</em></h2>
<p>Beef Taco is a fork of a popular Firefox add-on that went commercial and angered their userbase really fast.  I forked the old version and started maintaining it.  It got 9250+ downloads in 12 days.</p><p><b>Links</b><ul><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/180650/" target="_blank">Beef Taco on Mozilla.org</a></li><li><a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/06/17/forking-taco-2-0" target="_blank">My Explanation Of The Fork</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/17/firefox_taco_addon_beefs_up/" target="_blank">The Register Article (mention at the very bottom)</a></li><li><a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/06/18/2059222/TACO-Extension-for-Firefox-Forked-After-Proprietary-Update?from=rss" target="_blank">Slashdot Bit</a></li></ul></p>

<h2>Konami Unicorn Blitz<br/><em style="font-size: 12px;">May 2010</em></h2>
<p>Sparked by a little note on Boing Boing I hacked together a little JavaScript bit that would unleash a swarm of unicorns onto your screen when you entered the Konami Code.  After posting it on Hacker News I got some nice comments and contributions, including meeting a very cool guy named Eric Ryan Harrison.  It peaked at 2050 uniques on the day I released it.  No idea if it is deployed in the wild.</p>

<h2>Consume Less, Create More<br/><em style="font-size: 12px;">February 2010</em></h2>
<p>Consume Less, Create More was a minimalist website with some rotating quote, powered by jQuery.  It was just a little one-off plaything, but it was received pretty well.  It peaked at 1000+ uniques the first day it was out, and still gets about 10 a day.</p><p><b>Links</b><ul><li><a href="http://www.consumelesscreatemore.com/" target="_blank">Consume Less, Create More</a></li><li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1128574" target="_blank">Hacker News Comments</a></li></ul></p>

<h2>Storytlr<br/><em style="font-size: 12px;">January / February 2010</em></h2>
<p>Storytlr is a lifestreaming application that was open sourced in late 2009.  I loved it and grabbed a copy after segphault posted a review to Ars Technica.  Development was slow, so I jumped in and did a bunch of work.  My fork is sort of the default for "bleeding" edge installs, and I've done a lot of the development and plugins work since it came out.</p><p><b>Links</b><ul><li><a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/385487416/storytlr-php-lifestreaming-for-geeks" target="_blank">Featured on The ChangeLog</a></li><li><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr" target="_blank">My Fork</a></li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/" target="_blank">The Official Project Page</a></li><li><a href="http://lifestream.velvetcache.org/" target="_blank">My Lifestream</a></li></ul></p>
