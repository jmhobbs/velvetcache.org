## üéí Backpack

I've got a lightweight [Timbuk2](https://www.timbuk2.com/) laptop backpack that is 10+ years old, recommend without reservations.
Plus it came with a bottle opener on it.  I've got a more padded Timbuk2 for travel.

Inside I always carry:

 - [Zebra F-701](https://www.zebrapen.com/pages/f-701-all-metal-retractable-ballpoint) Pen
 - Legal Paper Pad
 - Every cable and dongle except the one I will actually need

# üíæ Software

For fonts I prefer things that do not have ligatures, I've settled on [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) but occasionally try others.

For colors, I like [Molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai). A matching theme for Alacritty is in [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jmhobbs/dotfiles/blob/main/config.mergedir/alacritty/alacritty.yml).

I use a lot of tools, so I'll just list my most commonly used ones below.

## üñäÔ∏è Editor

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) where possible, classic vim if it is not. VS Code if I have to.

My current config is available in [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jmhobbs/dotfiles/tree/main/config.mergedir/nvim) but the core plugins are:

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)|Bottom status bar|
|[CHADTree](https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree)|Tray file browser|
|[Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim)|Install external tools|

|[coq](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim)|Autocomplete|
|[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)|LSP easy mode|

## ü§ì Posix

Core software that I use on MacOS and on Linux.

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)|A fast and reliable terminal|
|[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)|Language and tool manager, think chruby+nvm+* all in one|
|[direnv](https://direnv.net/)|Load environment and configs per project|
|[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)|Great tool for untangling JSON|
|[gnupg](https://gnupg.org/)|I sign all my commits|

## üçé MacOS

I maintain a [Brewfile](https://github.com/jmhobbs/dotfiles/blob/main/Brewfile), but some favorites are:

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)|Quick launcher that is easy to customize|
|[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)|I run a lot in the tray, this keeps it trim|
|[Choosy](https://choosy.app/)|Cool default "browser" for launching other programs|
|[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)|Great docs reference tool|
|[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)|Position windows quickly|
|[One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing)|Keep my current task on top|
|[Viscosity](https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/)|Simple, effective VPN client|

## üêß Linux

I don't use a Linux desktop professionally, only for personal use, and not as much as I would like.

I generally use Debian or a derivative, `apt` is too deeply ingrained in me.

I prefer [sway](https://swaywm.org/), but I'll take [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/) as well.

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[bemenu](https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu)|Text based quick launcher, like dmenu|
|[swaylock-effects](https://github.com/jirutka/swaylock-effects)|Nice lock screen for sway|
|[waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)|Customizable top bar for sway|
|[ly](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly)|TUI display manager|
