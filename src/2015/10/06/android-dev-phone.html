title: $20 Android Dev Phone
type: post
---
<p>I've been doing a bit of Android dev work lately, just tinkering mostly, and I needed hardware to test on.</p>
<p>Following the advice of local Android guru <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkCorrado" target="_blank">Mark</a>, I just went to Amazon and bought something cheap running at least 4.0.  What I ended up with was a Verizon prepaid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2XX4OY" target="_blank">LG Optimus Exceed 2</a></p>

<p>The hardware is decent, especially for a $20 phone.  I've not used it a ton yet, but I would say this would almost be a tolerable daily use phone.  Camera sucks, but who cares.</p>
<p>Here's how I got it set up.</p>
<h1>Skip Activation</h1>
<p>Right after boot, you can skip activation with this sequence:</p>
<p><ol><li>Volume Up</li><li>Volume Down</li><li>Back Button</li><li>Home Button</li></ol></p>

<h1>Developer Mode</h1>
<p>Go to <tt>Settings &gt; General  &gt; About Phone  &gt; Software Information</tt> then tap <tt>Build Number</tt> seven times.</p>
<p>You should find a <tt>Developer Options</tt> in your main settings now.</p>
<p>There's one more step though on OS X. When connecting to USB, you only trigger debug mode by choosing <tt>Internet Connection &gt; Ethernet</tt> for the USB connection method.</p>

<h1>Root It</h1>
<p>The internet would have you believe that rooting your Optimus Exceed 2 is super easy.  For me, it was not.  There is a <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g3/general/guide-root-lg-firmwares-kitkat-lollipop-t3056951" target="_blank">one-click guide</a> but I had to fall back on the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/development/guide-root-method-lg-devices-t3049772" target="_blank">original set of scripts</a> to make it work, which took a couple tries.</p>
<p>But it worked!</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I've not actually used it for a lot of development yet, but I've loaded up some apps with the Play store and it's reasonably responsive.  I like it.</p>
