title: You Should Be Using Redis
type: post
---
<p>Today I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.heartlanddc.com/" target="_blank">HDC15</a> entitled, <em>You Should Be Using Redis</em></p>
<p>It covered all the basic data structures and many commands, as well as replication, sentinel and cluster.  I had a great time even though I was terrified.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, near the end of my talk Keynote froze and I lost the recording of the slideshow and audio, so I don't have that to share.</p>
<p>Instead, here are the slides, as well as slides+presenter notes.  Hopefully my notes don't contain anything embarrassing.</p>
