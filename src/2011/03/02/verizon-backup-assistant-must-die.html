<p>So, I got a Droid 2 a while back and duuring setup I turned on the Verizon Backup Assistant.  Garbage.  Pretty sure it was responsible for several crashes.</p>
<p>I was looking for a way to disable it without a rom or hard reset, since its baked in. Hard to find.  Eventually I found this nugget buried deep in a <a href="http://androidforums.com/incredible-support-troubleshooting/69089-disabling-vzw-backup-assistant.html" target="_blank">forum topic</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Be sure to have all your contacts backed up to your Gmail account. Check online before proceeding to step 2.</p><p>2) Log into your My Verizon account. Go to the contacts tab, sort by list view and select all contacts. Delete the entire list. There's a deleted contacts tab as well. Select that and delete anything that's in there.</p><p>3) Go into your Incredible settings tab, select applications, manage applications. Do not sort or filter, allow list to populate. Select Sync Service, (icon resembles backup assistant icon) select clear data.</p><p>4) Also in manage applications scroll down to backup assistant, select clear data. This should do it.</p><p>5) To verify backup assistant is now disabled, select settings, accounts and sync, then under manage accounts, select backup assistant. You should be looking at a license agreement screen. </p></blockquote>
<p>I skipped step #2, but it worked all the same.  Good fix, minimal investment, no crashes since.</p>
