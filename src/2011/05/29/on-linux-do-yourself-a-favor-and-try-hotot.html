<p>I've used a lot of twitter clients over the years, I even <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/projects/kicktweet/" target="_blank">wrote one back in '08</a>.  TweetDeck is pretty good, but Air is shoddy on 64-bit Linux, and so it didn't integrate well and would crash.</p>
<p>I rejected <a href="http://gwibber.com/" target="_blank">Gwibber</a> and <a href="http://choqok.gnufolks.org/" target="_blank">Choqok</a>, just not my style.  My old web standby <a href="http://brizzly.com/" target="_blank">Brizzly</a> seems pretty lame these days too.  Then I found <a href="http://www.hotot.org/" target="_blank">Hotot</a>.  It's awesome.  It's like a Linux native TweetDeck, but with a friendlier, more welcoming feel.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a Linux twitter client, you have <b>got</b> to give Hotot a try.</p>
