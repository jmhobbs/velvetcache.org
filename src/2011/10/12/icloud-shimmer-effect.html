title: iCloud Shimmer Effect

<p>Today Alex pointed out the new <a href="http://icloud.com/" target="_blank">iCloud website</a> had lot's of fancy effects.  One I liked best was the polished metal effect on the login box that shimmered when you moved your mouse.</p>
<p>I went ahead duplicated it as best I could in a short time.  There are some obvious differences in approach, but it's essentially the same.</p>

<p>One thing I did not do was the easing on the mouse move.  I really like that, but it would be time consuming to get it running.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not browser compatible.  I only tested it in Chrome 14.</p>
<p>Most of the work is done in two functions.</p>
<p><tt>mousemove</tt> takes the mouse position and converts it to a degree of rotation.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript">mousemove: function ( event ) {
  // Use the mouse x coordinate conbined with the window width to 
  // come up with a degree to rotate.  You can make it more responsive
  // by decreasing the reduction.
  var reduction = 200;
  var deg = ( window.innerWidth / 2 - event.clientX ) * -1 / reduction;
  if( deg != Shimmer.current_rotation ) { Shimmer.draw( deg ); }
}</pre></p>
<p><tt>draw</tt> rotates the canvas and draws the image onto it.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript">// Rotate the metal background
draw: function ( deg ) {
  Shimmer.current_rotation = deg;

  // Clear the canvas
  Shimmer.context.clearRect( 0, 0, Shimmer.canvas.width, Shimmer.canvas.height );
  Shimmer.context.save();

  // Set the rotation point at 50% from left and & 80px from top
  Shimmer.context.translate( Shimmer.center.x, 80 );

  // Rotate by degrees (convert to radians)
  Shimmer.context.rotate( deg * Math.PI / 180 );

  // Draw metal
  Shimmer.context.drawImage( Shimmer.image, Shimmer.offset.x, Shimmer.offset.y );

  // Clear transforms
  Shimmer.context.restore();
}</pre></p>
<p>That's essentially it. Simple, but visually powerful. The source is embedded in <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2011/10/12/icloud-shimmer-effect/">the demo</a> and commented.</p>
