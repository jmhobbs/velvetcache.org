<p>The Internet seems a bit sparse when looking for good demo code for using the <a href="https://github.com/kohana/oauth" target="_blank">Kohana 3 OAuth module</a> with Twitter.</p>
<p>I think the main issue is that the OAuth module isn't very well documented, and doesn't do API requests.  For that you need an API implementation, like <a href="https://github.com/shadowhand/apis" target="_blank">shadowhand/apis</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a gist I put together with an example controller for Twitter OAuth:</p>
