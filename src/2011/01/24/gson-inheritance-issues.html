<p>So, work has me writing Java for the first time in my life.  I needed to handle some data in JSON format, and was using <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Jackson</a> and it's ObjectMapper for a while.  Fast and a relatively nice interface.</p>
<p>Today I switched to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/" target="_blank">Gson</a> for the even simpler API.  It's slower, but I'm just munging little strings every once in a while, so that's not a problem.</p>
<p>The one thing I came across today that didn't go as expected was serialization with inheritance in my objects. Here's where I started:</p>
<p><pre lang="java" line="1">package org.velvetcache.java.toys;

import com.google.gson.Gson;

public class GsonToy {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Gson gson = new Gson();

    Core core = new Core();
    System.out.println( gson.toJson( core ) );
    
    Inherits inherits = new Inherits();
    System.out.println( gson.toJson( inherits ) );
  }

  public static class Core {
    public int inheritanceDepth = 1;
    public String className = "Core";
  }

  public static class Inherits extends Core {
    public int inheritanceDepth = 2;
    public String className = "Inherits";
  }

}</pre></p>
<p>I expected to see the JSON representing of each. Much to my surprise, I got this instead:</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript">{"inheritanceDepth":1,"className":"Core"}
{"inheritanceDepth":1,"className":"Core"}</pre></p>
<p>What the what?  Weird.  So I thought I'd try adding a constructor and setting it there.</p>
<p><pre lang="java" line="22">  public static class Inherits extends Core {
    public int inheritanceDepth = 2;
    public String className = "Inherits";
    
    public Inherits () {
      inheritanceDepth = 2;
      className = "Inherits";
    }
  }</pre></p>
<p>Again, no luck!  I got the same output as before.  I gave it one last shot.</p>
<p><pre lang="java" line="22">  public static class Inherits extends Core {    
    public Inherits () {
      inheritanceDepth = 2;
      className = "Inherits";
    }
  }</pre></p>
<p>That time I got it.</p>
<p><pre lang="javascript">{"inheritanceDepth":1,"className":"Core"}
{"inheritanceDepth":2,"className":"Inherits"}</pre></p>
<p>Strange.  So it seems that when serializing an object, Gson <em>looks</em> for the value of a field in the superclass.  However, when you are <em>in</em> the object you are accessing the local field.  It seems like a weird scope thing.  Interestingly, if you provide a new implementation at the subclass level it will use that one instead.</p>
<p>This seems to be noted in the user guide at "<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Finer-Points-with-Objects">Finer Points with Objects</a>".  I must have just missed it.</p>
<p><em>Fields corresponding to the outer classes in  inner classes, anonymous classes, and local classes are ignored and not included in serialization or deserialization</em></p>
<p>Easy enough, though a little annoying.</p>
