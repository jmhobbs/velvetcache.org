Absolutely awesome article. I wish I had written this myself... ;)\n\nI'm going to put this link on the official page. It's too useful to not share. \n\nAnd you're absolutely right about the database layer. It would probably be a good idea to use at least a lightweight abstraction like PDO. The only reason I haven't done this is because I really only use MySQL for the vast majority of my projects. And in MySQL I really only use the most basic of methods inside MySQLi. I wasn't even aware that the other DB implementations that PHP provides natively weren't more similiar. I'll have to think on this a bit and decide what the best course of action is.\n\nPart of my hesitation is that I truly intended PHPainfree to avoid the \"abstraction\" nightmare that a lot of the other frameworks provide. I already know SQL and all of the PHP db methods I need to use, so when a framework forces me to learn a whole new system (with new API calls) to make simple database queries, I get upset. If you have any suggestions, I'd like to hear it (we can take this discussion offline if you want. I'm really just curious for some outside perspective.)\n\nYou might be right in saying that this is a framework to build frameworks. I don't know if that's how I work, but PHPainfree naturally fits how I build my own applications.\n\nFor example, I'm currently building http://userping.com using PHPainfree, so the first thing I do is build my \"Controller\" object and name it $UserPing. Then, all of my methods exist as a sub-request under that object. I'm pretty close to releasing my service (it's commercial, so I can't really open source it at this point), but I'd be more than happy to let you look at the code under the \"friend-DA\" and see what you think of a large project built under PHPainfree.\n\nShoot me an email and we can talk more. Thanks for the great article. You are the man.\n\n-E","approved":true,"Type":"comment","parent_id":0},{"id":27867,"author":{"name":"Eric Ryan Harrison","email":"me@ericharrison.info","url":"http://ericharrison.info","ip":"155.8.89.2"},"date":"2010-06-08 13:44:29","content":"Also, another thing I do with PHPainfree that isn't documented anywhere (and probably should be) is in how I structure my templates.\n\nAs a non-designer, what I generally do on my projects is go and grab YUI's grids.css and use it for page structure. I like to use the three-column layout because it gives me some flexibility in placing my content.\n\nAnyway, so what I do is I create my \"base template\" (defined in $PainfreeConfig['BaseView']) as something like \"base.tpl\" under templates/.\n\nIn base.tpl, I define all of the overall page structure from \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; on down. I source in all of my javascript and css in base.tpl and set up YUI grids to handle my layout structure.\n\nInside base.tpl, I have my code examine $Painfree-\u0026gt;route by doing something like this:\n\nlist($view,$id,$action) = explode('/', $Painfree-\u0026gt;route);\n\nInside templates/, I create three folders (assuming a three-column layout) called templates/primary/, templates/secondary/, and templates/sidebar/. Then I have base.tpl look inside those folders for a file named $view . '.tpl'; If it exists, it includes it in place, otherwise it will include something like 'unknown.tpl' or 'default.tpl'.\n\nThen, all I have to do to make new \"pages\" is create a new file named $view.tpl in those folders. It gives me a lot of flexibility and the ability to make new content very quickly with very little overhead.\n\nIt's one of the main reasons why I didn't go with a more complex MVC model like you were talking about. There's no need for any complex data-passing (and it helps with server performance) when I can just call static PHP/HTML templates directly. Any magic processing that needs to happen occurs before the template is loaded by the \"Logic Controller\" and the template can then just access whatever data it needs.\n\nThis also gives me a little bit of flexibility at development time. I can rapidly prototype new features inside the templates and work out all the kinks inside the templates. Then when I've got everything working the way I want, I'll pull out all the PHP code into the main logic controller inside the includes/ folder. \n\nI also am able to use the templates as re-usable components. One of the pre-built peices of functionality that I have written but have yet to release into the main PHPainfree project is a caching mechanism. It's an application-level file cache, so nothing to extroardinary, but combined with the nicely segregated templates that I build, it goes a long way towards improving performance even more.","approved":true,"Type":"comment","parent_id":0},{"id":27868,"author":{"name":"john","email":"john@velvetcache.org","url":"http://www.velvetcache.org/","ip":"69.63.118.140"},"date":"2010-06-08 14:59:13","content":"See, that's exactly what I meant by \"a framework to build your own framework\".

It's a pretty cool recipe for healthy snack bars. I like to \"unhealthy it up\" a bit by adding M\u0026amp;M minis, but that's because I'm a disgusting pig. Anyway, here's his recipe:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nmix in a bowl:\n3 cups oats ( I had one cup quick-cooking and 2 cups rolled)\n1 c. crushed almond slices\n1 c. raisins\n1/2 c. flaxseed\n1/2 c. sesame seed\n1/4 c. mini m\u0026amp;m's\n1/4 c. craisins\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n \nevenly coat with:\n1 can sweetened condensed milk\n2 tbl melted butter\n1/4 tsp vanilla\n \nI pressed these into a bar pan, but the recipe called for a 9x13\nbake at 350 for 20 minutes (chewy) to 25 minutes (tough chewy)\n \nimportant:  Cut immediately after removing from oven.  Also, some said they needed to use butter/cooking spray before pressing into the pan, but I used stoneware and didn't have any issues.  however, I let them set up in the pan for maybe 10-15 minutes.  I think if I would have let them stay there too long, I would have had difficulty removing them.\n \nThe nice thing about this is that you can use 3 1/2 cups of anything you want and add it to the oats.  I also added the cinnamon and the vanilla--you could add cocoa, nutmeg, whatever you wanted.  you could even use other spices and salty ingredients if you wanted to go that route.
