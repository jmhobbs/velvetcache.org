<p>If you read my <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/about/" target="_blank">about page</a>, you'd learn that I play some guitar.  And what better way to enjoy a nice guitar than to plug it into a computer?  My thoughts exactly.  This leads me to record a lot of the stuff that filters into my head.</p>
<p>Here then, are recordings.  Many are only half-done, some are less that that, barely even ideas.  Have a listen or two, then check out <a href="http://www.nikolairocks.com/" target="_blank">Nikolai</a>, an Omaha band I'm in that's much more stable and friendly rock.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/RawkWIntro.mp3" target="_blank">Rawk</a></b><br/>This is my best attempt at a fast-paced metal-ish rock out song. Itâ€™s a five-piece band set, drums were done in Reason, like all my drums, and there are three quitars and a bass. Okay, itâ€™s not really a bass, itâ€™s a guitar processed and dropped an octave. Plus, itâ€™s got a rockin quote at the beginning.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/I%20Am%20John%20Hobbs.mp3" target="_blank">Imitation Is The Greatest Form Of Flattery</a></b><br/>If this title is true, then <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brogersrocks" target="_blank">Brandon Rogers</a> must be flattered. This is a barbershop quartet style song, in tribute to Brandonâ€™s â€œIâ€™ve Got A Jobâ€. You should go listen to his too, since itâ€™s the original and makes more sense than mine. Technically this isnâ€™t a quartet, because I had 7 tracks and up to 5 running at once. Whatever, I just wish I had brogerâ€™s quad-vocal chord set.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/Rawk3.mp3">Rawk 3</a></b><br/>The latest, greatest, cookie-cutter copy of the original Rawk. Has some really marginal tapping though, and a good pre-song quote, which is the hallmark of an awesome hardcore song. (Please see Analogâ€™s â€œChildhoods Endâ€ on â€œThe Contentionâ€ if you do not believe me.)</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/sleepy%20eyes.mp3" target="_blank">Sleepy Eyes</a></b><br/>I wrote this one and played it a few times with Ryan and Smith when we were going to make a branch off band. I really love this song, and I fully intend to clean up, re-record, make up the rest of the words and post it to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/johnhobbsmusic" target="_blank">myspace</a> someday.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/EatFresh.mp3" target="_blank">Eat Fresh</a></b><br/>This was inspired by this year's (2006) guys night.  We were walking back from Wal-Mart and started hardcore dancing and singing in the Gordmans parking lot.  Naturally it was awful and about something weird, fast food/shopping. Adam came up with the fantastic pit call "Subway: Eat Fresh" that gives this it's name.  I ended up actually recording this because I was looking for a combination of distortion/eq/filters/whatever that would render vocals into a throaty hXc growl.  I think it's okay, but you can hear the distortion patterning every once in a while.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/ALL_GUITAR.mp3" target="_blank">All Guitar</a></b><br/>Believe it or not (go listen first) this song is simply 4 guitars. No drum machine or keyboard. Although to be fair there is lots of really processed harmonics and an analog sequencer used to pulse the volume on one guitar for the percussive section.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/Diadem.mp3" target="_blank">Diadem</a></b><br/>This was actually a song I wrote and played with Never Luke, but it was a tad repetitive and boring so we dropped it. This isnâ€™t a great version, mostly I was syncing up my drums part so I could record a â€œgoodâ€ version for myspace. As such the guitars are a bit nasty sounding, and there are some ugly â€œimprovisationsâ€ on the lead track.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/music/Rawk2.mp3" target="_blank">Rawk 2</a></b><br/>Awful. Really, I donâ€™t know why I saved this. At around 0:42 a â€œsoloâ€ starts that is just wrong. Itâ€™s not even in the right key, or really even all that cool anyway. Bleah.</p>
