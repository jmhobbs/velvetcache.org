<p>I'm taking a GUI design class right now and for slightly odd reasons he is having us do mini-projects in Photoshop and Flash.

I choose the gates to Mordor and I'm quite proud of the results.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Click through for the full size, it's worth it I think.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/2/class-photoshop-project/lance_mordor.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/2/class-photoshop-project/lance_mordor_sm.jpg"/></a></p>
