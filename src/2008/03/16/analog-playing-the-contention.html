<p>I was looking around YouTube and I thought I'd see if there was any of Analog's music on there.  They were a big player in the hardcore scene in Omaha when I was in high school, I probably went to their shows a few times a month on average.  Amazing band.</p><p>I found this video from the Sam Herrington Memorial show at the Rock..  I don't remember what year it was, but it was the most insane hardcore pit I had ever seen.  Had to have been 30+ people dancing at once, it was crazy.  Lots of headwalking at the end, around 3:15.  Anyway, I thought I'd post it in memoriam of the more or less dead 402 scene.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://media.dreamhost.com/swfobject.js"></script>
