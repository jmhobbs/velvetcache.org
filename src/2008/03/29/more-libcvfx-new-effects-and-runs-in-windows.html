title: 'More libcvfx: New effects and runs in Windows'
type: post
---
<p>I got libcvfx compiled on Windows with Dev-C++.  I don't have it as a library or anything, just got the demo working for now, proof of concept if you will.  It was a bit slower on Windows, and I didn't get the 640x480 out of my web cam.  Additionally the highgui didn't register the arrow keys right so I had to change those.</p><p>What I was really wanting to see was if it would run in Windows at all.  This would possibly open up a bigger range of web cams for the CameraBooth project, perhaps some of the higher end, higher resolution ones.</p><p>Anyway, here's a screen of it running on Windows and one on Linux for good measure. Click through for the big images.</p><p><b>Windows</b><br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/libcvfxOnWindows.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/libcvfxOnWindows_sm.jpg" /></a><br/><b>Linux</b><br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/libcvfxOnLinux.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/libcvfxOnLinux_sm.jpg" /></a></p><p>Additionally I've added a few new effects since the last post.  Some don't capture well, so I'll just describe those ones.</p><p><b>Photo Copy</b><br/>This one takes a threshold and any pixel under the threshold is turned black, any pixel over it is turned a user specified color, default is white. This tends to be harsh, it might be good to run a blur on it or maybe set a few midpoint values between black and the color to fuzz it a bit.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205288915_photoCopy.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205288915_photoCopy_sm.jpg" /></a><br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338526_photoCopy.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338526_photoCopy_sm.jpg" /></a></p><p><b>HStripFlip</b><br/>Cuts the image into as many strips as you want, then flips every other strip. Defaults to 4 strips.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338499_hStripFlip.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338499_hStripFlip_sm.jpg" /></a><br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338509_hStripFlip.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338509_hStripFlip_sm.jpg" /></a></p><p><b>Corners</b><br/>This isn't a new effect, but now you can choose which corners to exchange.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338832_corners.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvfxTest_capture_1205338832_corners_sm.jpg" /></a></p><p>There are a number of effects I didn't take pictures for.</p><p><b>VStripFlip</b> is like HStripFlip except vertical. <br/><b>Broken Television</b> is a motion effect where the image scrolls like an out of sync TV. Hard to describe really. <br/><b>Noise</b> just injects pseudo-random pixels into the image, but it does a poor job of it right now.<br/><b>Interlace Lines</b> replaces every other horizontal line with all black.</p><p>I'll have more about these effects as well as pictures and maybe video once I get a project page set up for libcvfx.  For now you can hit up the repo for source, or grab the Window binary <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/3/29/more-libcvfx-new-effects-and-runs-on-windows/cvFcTest.exe">here</a>. You will need the OpenCV libraries installed, and in your PATH.</p>
