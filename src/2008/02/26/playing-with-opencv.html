<p>OpenCV is a cross platform video library I've been playing with.  Today I coded up a horizontal mirror effect, took about 30 minutes.  I worked out all the byte manipulations on a piece of paper, that took the longest.  Coding was a breeze with OpenCV, and I tried out some of the built in effects too, stacking them on top of each other.</p>
<p>Here's my first version source for the mirror effect, it's rough since I just translated what I had written down into code. "<tt>frame</tt>" is a captured IplImage.
<pre lang="cpp" line="1">int halfsies = frame->width/2;
for(int i = 0; i < frame->height; i++) {
  int offset = i*frame->width*3;
  for(int j = 0; j < halfsies; j++) {
    frame->imageData[offset+(frame->width*3-1)-2-(j*3)] = frame->imageData[offset+(j*3)];
    frame->imageData[offset+(frame->width*3-1)-1-(j*3)] = frame->imageData[offset+(j*3)+1];
    frame->imageData[offset+(frame->width*3-1)-(j*3)] = frame->imageData[offset+(j*3)+2];
  }
}</pre></p>
<p>Here is the reformed version, cleaner by far.
<pre lang="cpp" line="1">int halfFrame = frame->width/2;
int frameBytes = frame->width*3-1;
for(int i = 0; i < frame->height; i++) {
  int offset = i*frame->width*3;
  for(int j = 0; j < halfFrame; j++) {
    int jBytes = offset+frameBytes-(j*3);
    int ojBytes = offset+(j*3);
    frame->imageData[jBytes-2] = frame->imageData[ojBytes];
    frame->imageData[jBytes-1] = frame->imageData[ojBytes+1];
    frame->imageData[jBytes] = frame->imageData[ojBytes+2];
  }
}</pre></p>
<p>And here is what it looks like. The first one is without any other effects, the second is with the OpenCV effect "erode".<div style="text-align: center"> <img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/2/26/playing-with-opencv/fxTest_capture_1204065504.jpg"/><br/> <img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/2/26/playing-with-opencv/fxTest_capture_1204066418.jpg"/></div></p>
<p>You can get the full source of my fxTest.cpp <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/2/26/playing-with-opencv/fxTest.cpp" target="_blank">here</a> if you want it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs512/lect-notes/opencv-intro/index.html" target="_blank">Introduction to programming with OpenCV</a> was a great resource for me.</p>
