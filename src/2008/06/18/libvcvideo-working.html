<p>I started yet another project a few weeks ago.  This one, called libvcvideo, is intended to be a super simple way to access video devices, especially web cams.  I've been writing it to replace the more feature rich, but heavier OpenCV in my other projects.  Yesterday in class I got the first working product, so I made a flurry of refinements, added some documentation, and I'm now showing it off.</p>
<p>It's nothing amazing yet, it only works in Linux on V4L devices that are web cams and use the RGB24 data format.  That said, it's still a lot of devices, especially from the spca5xx and gspca drivers.</p>
<p>I'll be adding more to it over time, but here is some proof of concept items.</p>
<p>Here is a fullscreen shot of the library running my gtkmm test program.  The library was compiled with it's debug option which provides all that information in the terminal window.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/06/18/libvcvideo-working/proof_of_concept.png"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/06/18/libvcvideo-working/proof_of_concept_sm.png"/></a></p>
<p>One cool thing I added is a sigc++2 signal for measuring the progress of operations.  Here I have it hooked up to my gtkmm test program showing where it is in the initialization process.<br/><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/06/18/libvcvideo-working/loading_bar.png"/></p>
<p>Here is the first image I captured with the library. If it looks a little off color, it is because I hadn't corrected the byte ordering on the format yet, so blue and red are swapped.  Yes, it is a boring first image, but the camera was under my desk and I didn't want to offend the teacher by openly working on this during a macroeconomics lecture.<br/><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/06/18/libvcvideo-working/First%20Image%20Captured.jpg"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2008/06/18/libvcvideo-working/First%20Image%20Captured_sm.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Here is about the most simple example possible.  It safely creates, opens, initializes, and grabs a frame from the device "/dev/video0".
<pre lang="cpp">
#include <iostream >
using std::cerr;
using std::endl;
#include <string >
using std::string;

#include "lib/videoDevice.h"

int main (int argc, char ** argv) {
  vc::videoDevice device ("/dev/video0");
  vc::vdFrame frame;

  try {
    device.init();
  }
  catch(string s) {
    cerr << "Device initialization failed: " << s << endl;
    exit(1);
  }

  try {
    device.getFrame(frame);
  }
  catch(string s) {
    cout << "Failed to get frame: " << s << endl;
    exit(1);
  }
}
</pre></p>
