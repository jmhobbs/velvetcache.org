So I was wandering around the net and found Google lab's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">"Google Notebook"</a>
I said to myself, "Myself", I said, "That is some cool stuff".  It's a nice little framework that will probably end up holding all my notes from all my classes next semester, it's that spiffy.

I still think I want to write my own notes thingy, since Google's version doesn't seem to have collaborative notebooks, could only be a matter of time though.

On that note, however, I must say I have got to get into this AJAX and XMLHTTPRequest or whatever the heck this stuff uses, because it is thoroughly (sp?) and absolutely dynamic and makes for pretty web apps.  Maybe I'll try out some Ruby too, I've heard nothing but good about it.

So many cool things, so little time.
