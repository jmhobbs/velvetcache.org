Every self-respecting geek has projects. I mean, come on, how else do we avoid social interaction? Linus had his Sinclair QL and Linux, I have my AMD Sempron and PHP. So, I'll post my projects, and their code, soon. If you (the readers who do not actually exist) take a liking to a project, feel free to email me. Or just take the source and send me what you've done with it!

I could especially use some help on my SimpleNotes project, a collaborative note system. I want it toget really slick, eventually with real time (almost) tracking of updates.

Until later go read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066620732/sr=8-1/qid=1145999882/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1780950-5071260?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Just For Fun</a>, I just finished it, very cool for geeky open-source types.  Also, listen to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.showbread.net/">Showbread.</a>   May raw rock kill you everyday forever and ever amen.
