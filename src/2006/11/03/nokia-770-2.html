<p>My <a href='http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/10/06/nokia-770/' target='_blank'>Nokia 770</a> came today! This one wasn't <a  href='http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/10/11/nokia-770-review/' target='_blank'>bricked on arrival like the last one</a>.  I immediately started in on it, and within an hour I had it loaded up with lots of apps from <a href='www.maemo.org' target='_blank'>maemo.org</a>.  By now I've rooted it and have some scripts set up to handle mounting shares from my network. As a bonus I've managed to lock up the application manager, an apt frontend, I think I need a reboot to kill off the process. Lord knows I'm not going to try and kill it myself.</p>
<p>Only a few minor complaints at this point.  The handwriting recognition is horrid, but the keyboard has a nice feel to it and you get phone-like word completion. I haven't tried the fingerboard style yet, rugt now I'm writing this with two styluss (styli?) and I'm actually getting rather fast at it. Maye its th qwerty keyboard.</p>
<p>The other pet peeve came when I wa writing my shell scripts in vi and couldn't find a way to send the escape key to it. I just now realized that there is a hardware back key that would be a likely candidate. Oops.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm gonna reboot her and see about getting descent or doom running :)</p>
<div class="update"><p><b>Update (11/03/06)</b><br/>I got Doom running, how cool is that.  This is by far the neatest gadget ever.  I need a bigger mem card, then I'll push the root FS onto the card and I can have it all :)</p></div>
