title: More GIMP Goodness
type: post

<p>I'm getting more and more confident in GIMP now.  Last night I forced myself to do some layout work for Leigh's dance studio site in GIMP and I'm very satisfied.  I have the example of about two hours of work.  Yes, I probably could have made it in about one if I had Photoshop, but thats all part of getting better at something.  I may soon feel confident enough to never fall back onto Photoshop again.  Anyway, here's the layout so far, below is a snippet and it links to the full size 800x600 layout.  Really only the header is "finished".  And even it is going to be a bit lighter in shade.</p>
