<img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/11/27/wonderful-old-things/samhair.gif" alt="Sam Hair" style="float: right; padding: 2px;" /><p>I was wandering through the contents of an old hard drive and found some neat stuff I made back in freshman year.  The first article is a spastic little animated gif of a few pages of notebook paper.  Sam Hair.  Rad.</p>
<p>The next two are videos.  One is a painfully rotoscoped video of my room mate Joe swinging a light saber around.  The next is a short claymation of a turtle and a bird.  I had a lot of spare time freshman year. Click the links to view them.</p>
