<p>I'm a long time Photoshop user.  I started in high school in journalism class and I've been through several versions up to CS2 today.  I love Photoshop to death.  However, I run Linux now, and dual booting would suck.  Qemu doesn't cut it eaither and I don't think Wine handles CS2 very well at all.</p>
<p>There is a program called GIMP, GNU Image Manipulation Program, for Linux that is equivalent and I've tried many times to come to grips with it's different interface.  I used to despise GIMP, well, I still despise GIMP, but at least now I can work in it.</p>
<p>Here is my first piece of decent work to come out of gimp. A nice, shiny, flare-y, striped glass web 2.0 bar. It was a good learning experience and I thought I'd share it's beauty.</p>
