<p>I got my Arduino board today, and I went to check out the IDE.  It's written in Java.  Holy freakin' cow.  Couldn't be more perfect because it's all written and released under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License" target="_blank">LGPL</a>!  I found the <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/arduino/trunk/app/Serial.java?view=markup" target="_blank">Serial.java</a> in the SVN trunk, and I'm reasonably certain I can figure it out enough to use it.  You wouldn't believe how happy I am right now.  I need some breadboard and LED's.</p>
