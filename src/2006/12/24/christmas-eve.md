Hey, it's Christmas eve, and you know what that means?  I'm still playing with my computer, like usual.  On Friday we had a show at Sokol underground, and I thought it went pretty well.  Lots of people there, and we haven't played in a few months so it was fun.  Afterwards we went to Villiage Inn and ate breakfasty foods.

Afterwards Darcy gave me the absolute best Christmas present ever, Star Wars Mr. Potato Heads.  I kid you not.  It was a bundle with Darth Tater, a Spudtrooper and R2-D2 (potato version).  There is nothing I can think of which would not wither in comparison to such a gift.

In the way less awesome but still cool category I used some info from the ["Zune on Linux via VMware"](http://www.zune-online.com/news/zune/zune-on-linux-via-vmware.html) post over at zune-online.com to get my Zen MicroPhoto working.  I used to use my Windows box to load up my Zen but now it's in the basement for recording and I don't have that much cat5.  The key was turning off USB 2.0 as mentioned in article with the command `sudo rmmod ehci_hcd`.

I've never had any luck with libmtp and gnomad2 working with my Zen in the past but hopefully the Zune will create more active development on the library and we can get some MTP goodness going on.  I read somewhere that Feisty Fawn's Amarok should have MTP compiled in, but we'll see.  Now I just need someone to hack up the firmware to get OGG support on the Zen.
