It's been a while since my last post here.  Nine whole days to be approximate.  Thats like, a week and two days.  That may as well be forever in the world of the internet!

So what mischief have I been up to in those nine long days?  Well, first and foremost I turned 21 in there.  I had some excellent pizza and mountain dew and many rousing rounds of _Catch Phrase_. Aside from that I've worked and worked on [BlowPass](https://static.velvetcache.org/projects/blowpass/), my Blowfish based, browser encrypted password management tool.  I've also been working on [SedaliaBalletSchool.com](http://www.sedaliaballetschool.com) and a super-secret project that is just going to rock your world.  Or the world of UNO students I hope.

Go check out BlowPass if you have a moment.  Merry Christmas if I don't post again before it. :)
