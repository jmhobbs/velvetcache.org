<p>I happened upon this news today.  A company called Multiverse has purchased the rights to create a <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/" target="_blank">Firefly</a> game.  They're saying it'll be an MMO.  That would honestly be enough to make me dual boot again.  Firefly is that awesome.</p>
