So I've gotten all the posts over from the old system.  I've had alot of trobule with getting <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.igeek.info/wp-plugins/igsyntax-hiliter/">iG:Syntax Hiliter</a> to behave, though it's mostly my own fault for not understanding the options and the styling.  The "plain text" links still weren't working, so I took them off.

I've been finding little flaws in the theme here and there, and just today created a home.php to override the index and give this nice custom job, more like the old page.  I also had problems getting <a target="_blank" href="http://leflo.de/projekte/wordpress/scrobbler">scrobbler</a> to work.  I finally realized it wasn't scrobbler that was messed up, it was <a target="_blank" href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">wp-cache</a> making the dynamic <a target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> content into cached copies.

I figured that out after pulling scrobbler and inserting my own last.fm code straight into the template.  Not the best solution, but I never intend on releasing this template as public anyway.

Still chugging away at the static site, should have some of my content back soon.
