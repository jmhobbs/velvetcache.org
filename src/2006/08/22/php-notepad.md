Last semester I used the program [KJots](http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeutils/kjots/index.html) alot for taking notes in my computer classess.  It's a great program, but it had some glitches I didn't like and was platform specific.

For a long time I had the notion of making my own similar program, either in nice portable Java or as a web technology.  This afternoon I had about three hours between classes and whipped up a basic frame of the system.  I skipped the "making it pretty" part since I was just getting it going.  It needs that, plus you can't save changes yet, but other than that it's there.  I'd finish it up, but I have class in about 10.  Anyway, check out my demo/live version [here](/projects/notepad/).  User is "demo@example.com" and pass is "demo".  You can get a clean copy of the source at [this link](/projects/notepad/notepad.zip).  Hopefully some of this code can be built into [lucidGW](http://lucid.velvetcache.org/), esp. the authentication code.
