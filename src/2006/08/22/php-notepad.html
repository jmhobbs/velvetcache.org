Last semester I used the program <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeutils/kjots/index.html">KJots</a> alot for taking notes in my computer classess.  It's a great program, but it had some glitches I didn't like and was platform specific.

For a long time I had the notion of making my own similar program, either in nice portable Java or as a web technology.  This afternoon I had about three hours between classes and whipped up a basic frame of the system.  I skipped the "making it pretty" part since I was just getting it going.  It needs that, plus you can't save changes yet, but other than that it's there.  I'd finish it up, but I have class in about 10.  Anyway, check out my demo/live version <a target="_blank" href="http://www.velvetcache.org/projects/notepad/">here</a>.  User is "demo@example.com" and pass is "demo".  You can get a clean copy of the source at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.velvetcache.org/projects/notepad/notepad.zip">this link</a>.  Hopefully some of this code can be built into <a target="_blank" href="http://lucid.velvetcache.org/">lucidGW</a>, esp. the authentication code.
