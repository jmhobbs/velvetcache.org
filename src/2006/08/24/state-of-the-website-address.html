I've been wokring on alot of web apps recently, and I've been cleaning up the 404's and misc. pages around velvetcache.

Today I tried (reasonably hard) to get <a target="_blank" href="http://www.typosphere.org/">typo</a> running.  I never did, probably because there seems to be absolutely no documentation out there and I don't know ruby.  Instead I dropped in a copy of <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>'s excellent One-Click install system.

I've got to say, WordPress is extremely nifty, and the amount of plugins is enormous.  If you want to look at it it's at <a href="http://typo.velvetcache.org/">http://typo.velvetcache.org/</a> <em>(dead link)</em>, though to be honest it's just a wordpress blog with some broken css (plugin issues).

I'm going to play with it some more and try to theme it.  It's a really nice app with lots of support, and to be honest, I doubt I'll ever "finish" my system (I'm still inserting new blog posts via phpMyAdmin!) and even if I do, it won't be anywhere near as cool.  I guess we'll see.
