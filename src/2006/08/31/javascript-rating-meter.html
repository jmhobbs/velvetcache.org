<em><strong>Update: </strong>A newer version is outlined in <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/09/01/javascript-rating-meter-2/">this</a> post.</em>

Due to a discussion I had earlier today, I was thinking about how to make one of those little star meters where you can click to set the rating and they change colors.  I took some time to code up this quick version.

I didn't want to use image swapping, because that wouldn't be as flexible.  So instead, you change the background color and have a transparent cutout of the image you want over that.  It'll make more sense once I get an example made.

For now, here's my prototype.  It needs a lot of work to make it into a good script, but it's a start.  <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/08/31/javascript-rating-meter/">Example Here</a>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1">
var sets = Array();

function hover(level) {
for(j = 1; j <= level; j++)
{
document.getElementById('S'+j).style.backgroundColor = "#0FF";
}
for(k = (level+1); k <= 5; k++)
{
document.getElementById('S'+k).style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
}
}

function unhover(group) {
for(j = 1; j < 6; j++)
{
if(sets[group] == null)
{
document.getElementById('S'+j).style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
}
else
{
if(sets[group] >= j)
{
document.getElementById('S'+j).style.backgroundColor = "#F00";
}
else
{
document.getElementById('S'+j).style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
}
}
}
}

function set(group,level) {
sets[group] = level;
}</pre>
