title: Complexity Vs. Redundancy

<p>I just wrote the following line of code as part of an implementation of a bucket sort.
<pre lang="cpp">bucket[(array[j]/static_cast<int>(pow(10.0,y)))%BUCKETS].Enqueue(array[j]);</pre>  Somehow I feel wrong inside about it.  Look at it, it's fairly complicated.  In the context of the program you <u>could</u> work out what it was doing, but the effort would be made easier if it was rewritten as this.
<pre lang="cpp">int temp = ( array[j] / static_cast<int>( pow(10.0, y) ) ) % BUCKETS;
bucket[temp].Enqueue(array[j]);</pre>
</p>
<p>Just splitting up that nasty math part from the method call clear up a bit of the ambiguity of what the line is doing, and the next version is even better.
<pre lang="cpp" line="1">// Returns a set number of digits from an
// integer in the array, based on the number
// of buckets and the current iteration.
// For example:
//     array[j] = 123456;
//     y = 4;
//     BUCKETS = 100;
// Then:
//     temp = 12;
int temp = ( array[j] / static_cast<int>( pow(10.0, y) ) ) % BUCKETS;
bucket[temp].Enqueue(array[j]);</pre>
</p>
<p>While this doesn't <u>really</u> tell you whats going on, it can lead you to finding the pattern involved.  That pattern is described thus:</p>
<p><i>For an integer <b>N</b>, the digit <b>X</b> positions to the left of the least significant digit is: <b>(N/10^X)%(10^Y)</b>  Where <b>Y</b> is a "look-ahead" to retrieve the next-<b>Y</b> digits as well.</i></p>

Thats my informal definition mix for base 10 numbers, derived from a few dozen minutes of fighting with <a href="http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man1/bc.1.html" target="_blank">bc</a>.  I <u>could</u> put this information into the program, and then deciphering it's workings would be a snap.  But why?  I mean, I'm never going to use this again, and if I need to, I worked it out the first time, the second shouldn't be any harder.  How much documentation is too much?  How much is too little?
</p>
<p>I hate bloated files, sources that are so filled with comments you never see any code.  I think (like many before me) that code should be self-documenting as much as possible.  I don't belive in using in-line comments.  They get in the way and don't often help.  But I've also always thought you shouldn't break out the comment blocks for anything that wasn't "serious", so do I lower the definition of a "serious" comment, or do I throw away my would-be in-liners?</p>
<p>I suppose this is one of those things that comes with time, but I've tried to maintain old code before, that someone else wrote with zero comments, and it's impossible.  I think I'll err on the side of caution, for whoever comes after me.</p>
