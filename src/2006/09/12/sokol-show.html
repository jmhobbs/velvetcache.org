<p>So tommorow is the big day for Never Luke.  We play at Sokol in the River Concert Series.  As a bonus Adam and Brandon will be on the morning show (Spicoli I think).  I can't make it because I have my first Calc test, but whatever.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.897theriver.com" target="_blank">the river</a> doesn't stream their radio over the net (what?! lame...) and I wanted to rip the interview of the guys so I could listen later and save it for posterity.  So today I worked up a little hack to get a crisp, clean recording.  I connected my <a href="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=14107" target="_blank">Creative Labs Zen MicroPhoto</a> to a dual-rca cable, then ran that into two inputs on the <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Delta1010LT-main.html" target="_blank">M-Audio Delta 1010LT</a>.  I also hooked the USB up to my Linux box so it would stay charged.</p>
<p>Now the key thing here is that the Zen can play FM radio, and record it.  However, I didn't want to be fishing around in my pocket to turn off the Zen when I'm supposed to be integrating something.  So the solution was <a href="http://www.blazeaudio.com/products/powerrecord.html" target="_blank">Blaze Audio Power Record</a> which lets you do scheduled recordings.  Neat-o.  Anyway, it's going to work, so I'm happy.  I'll post it here and over at <a href="http://www.neverlukeband.com/" target="_blank">Never Luke</a> once I get it cleaned up.</p>
<p style="border: 2px dashed #DDD; padding: 3px;">Update:  It didn't work.  Somewhere in there I switched a setting around and screwed it up.  I'm supposed to get a taped copy from Leigh though, so it might be okay after all.</p>
