<p>I'm a fan of portable applications.  One of my professors used portable Firefox in class once, and now I'm hooked.  It's so handy to have every program I need right at my fingertips on any (windows) machine I use.  So what apps are on my 1Gb disk's right now?</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid #777; float: right; margin: 2px; font-size: 9px; text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/PStart_sm.png" alt="PStart Menu" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000;"/><br/><a href="javascript:popUp1('http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/PStart.png');">PStart Menu</a></div>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pegtop.de/start/" target="_blank">PStart</a></strong><br/>This little system-tray launcher is the backbone of any good USB apps setup.  Easy to configure and handy to have around.</p>

<p><strong>Eclipse and JDK 1.5</strong><br/>Thats right, I've got a Java compiler wherever I go.  I haven't had any problems with this yet, and since it's got the JRE in there too, Eclipse can run anywhere.  This was a little more trouble to install than most, but really not all that bad.  <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/category/computers/software/eclipse/">Instructions</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" target="_blank">Firefox</a></strong><br/>Nothing better than having all your extensions with you, and all you cache and history to yourself. Thats really all there is to say.  If there is one app that I use the most on USB, it's Firefox</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid #777; float: right; margin: 2px; font-size: 9px; text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/PuTTY_sm.png" alt="PStart Menu" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000;"/><br/><a href="javascript:popUp2('http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/PuTTY.png');">PuTTY Config</a></div>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="_blank">PuTTY</a></strong><br/>This is <u>the</u> terminal application to use on Windows.  It's easy to use, small, portable, and reliable. I use it almost every day to get onto Vulcan or my home machines.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="_blank">WinSCP</a></strong><br/>This falls into the same category as PuTTY.  It's a great all-around file transfer client with secure protocols built in.  Great application.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm" target="_blank">Notepad++</a></strong><br/>For a long time I was looking for a simple text editor that had syntax highlighting, but was light and easy.  I tried cream for a time then I found Notepad++.  It works quite well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/winvncviewer.html" target="_blank">RealVNC Viewer</a></strong><br/>For those times when you can't get something done over SSH in the terminal, I use RealVNC to get to my desktop and take care of it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.xlightftpd.com/" target="_blank">Xlight FTPD</a></strong><br/> Take an FTP server with you wherever you go.  Not useful very often, but when it is, it's great.</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid #777; float: right; margin: 2px; font-size: 9px; text-align: center;"><img src="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/KisKis_sm.png" alt="PStart Menu" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000;"/><br/><a href="javascript:popUp3('http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/KisKis.png');">KisKis Entry</a></div>

<p><strong><a href="http://kiskis.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">KisKis</a></strong><br/>Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe.  This is a good java password manager.  It's java, thus cross-platform, which is key for a password safe.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop CS</strong><br/>This one is a bit shady.  I bet you didn't know that Adobe made a portable Photoshop CS.  They don't.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/gaim_portable" target="_blank">Gaim</a></strong><br/>Gaim is an instant message client, you can do AIM, MSN, Jabber, even IRC.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.quate.net/newsnet/read.php?id=32" target="_blank">RSSOwl</a></strong><br/>The best RSS reader I've ever found.  Plus it's java, so with some tweaked scripts this can run on linux and windows, all of the USB stick.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php" target="_blank">Foxit PDF Reader</a></strong><br/>I hate Acrobat Reader with a passion.  Foxit is light and free.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/Explore_USB.bat" target="_blank">Explore_USB.bat</a></strong><br/>In addition to my standard programs I have a few simple batch files I made to ease the use of my USB apps.  These are simple one-liners, but they are handy to have around.  First among them is my <tt>Explore_USB.bat</tt>.  I got tired of all the effort involved in opening an explorer window on my drive.  Since I have a my portable apps separated from the rest of the drive I used <tt>..</tt> to jump to my drive root.  This one comes into use most of all the batch files.<pre lang="dos">@start explorer ..</pre></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/pages/2006/09/28/usb-apps/cmd.bat" target="_blank">cmd.bat</a></strong><br/>This one is another obvious one, launch a "dos" command window without getting the start panel involved.  Like I said, these are really simple shortcut files.<pre lang="dos">@start cmd</pre></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/" target="_blank">DSLinux</a></strong><br/>This is a nice, full distribution that uses Knoppix to pack a ton of apps into a 50 meg disc.  I use the "embedded" version which comes with qemu binaries for windows and linux. No matter where I am I have a linux machine. As long as its not on a mac I guess. This has it's own 1 gig stick, lots of /home space.</p>
