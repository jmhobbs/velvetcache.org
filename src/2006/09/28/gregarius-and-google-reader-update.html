title: Gregarius And Google Reader Update
type: post
---
<p>I just finished installing <a href="http://gregarius.net/" target="_blank">Gregarius</a> because I wanted to access my feeds no matter where I was and have a consistent read/unread status across all machines.  Before I used to use RSSOwl, which is a great app, but when I got home I would have to go through and "read" items I had already read elsewhere. I had tried <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>, but there weren't enough features.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as soon as I installed <a href="http://rss.velvetcache.org/" target="_blank">Gregarius on Dreamhost</a> one of the first feed's was Robert Scoble's.  It was a brief on the <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/09/28/google-reader-updates-and-a-video-too/" target="_blank">new Google Reader features</a>.  I'm going to try out the new Google Reader, but for now I'll leave Gregarius installed, as it's a very nice application.</p>
