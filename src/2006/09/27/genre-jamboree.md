I was looking at my top artists over at last.fm and noticed that I have some weird tastes. I made a table of my top 10, along with the genre I consider them in.

|**#**|**Artist**|**Plays**|**Genre**|
|-----|----------|---------|---------|
|1|Ozma|494|Indie Rock|
|2|August Burns Red|469|Metal|
|3|The Weakerthans|398|Canadian Sweetness|
|4|Showbread|308|Raw Rock|
|5|Death Cab for Cutie|276|Indie|
|6|The Shins|241|Indie|
|7|Weezer|185|Alt. Rock|
|8|Relient K|184|Pop Punk|
|9|He Is Legend|180|Hardcore?|
|10|Ted Leo and The Pharmacists|154|Indie Punk|
|11|Scary Kids Scaring Kids|153|Spazcore|
|12|Allister|122|Pop Punk|
|13|Bloc Party|106|Indie|
|14|Analog|102|Hardcore|
|15|The Fall of Troy|98|Technical Metalcore|

What does all this mean?  Maybe nothing at all, I'm just posting it for posterity (and as a must-listen list)
