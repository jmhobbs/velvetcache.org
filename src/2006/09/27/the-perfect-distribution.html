<p>I was doing a search to try and get SpellBound installed in Firefox, when I came across this blog entry on a blog that had some SpellBound instructions. <a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2005/08/29/your-perfect-linux-distro/" target="_blank">Your Perfect Linux Distro</a>  It looked neat so I took the test.</p>
<p>It's a very well done page, very smooth and easy to follow with some nice design.  It ended up telling me that Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora were my "perfect" matches.  That's pretty reasonable since I used Debian for a long time before switching to Ubuntu.  Plus Ubuntu was based off of Debian Sid if I remember correctly. Neat test, well done.  <a href="http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/index.php" target="_blank">Take It Here</a></p>
