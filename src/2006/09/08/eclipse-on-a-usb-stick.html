<p>Note: Forgive the formatting, I need to change my styles.css to get ordered lists back.</p>
<p>I'm taking a Java course this semester and it was annoying not having access to Eclipse on the various computers in labs around campus.  So I applied some of my Google-fu and found a way to install Eclipse on a USB stick.</p> <p>The original instructions are <a href="http://portableapps.com/node/929" target="_blank">here</a>, way at the bottom of the page.  I relocated them here and changed them to mirror my experience.</p>
<p><ol><li>Download <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> and install it on your USB drive.  I used <a href="http://easyeclipse.org/site/distributions/desktop-java.html" target="_blank">EasyEclipse For Desktop Java</a> from nexB.</li>
<li>Install a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">JDK</a> on your or any other PC. The default installation path should be something like &quot;C:\Programs\Java&quot;, containing a folder named &quot;jdk1.5.0_xx&quot;</li>
<li>Create a subfolder &quot;JDKs&quot; in your Eclipse folder (Depending on your drive letter and extraction path this should look like E:\Portables\Eclipse\JDKs</li>
<li>Copy the jdk1.5.0_xx folder into the JDKs folder. (like E:\Portables\Eclipse\JDKs\jdk1.5.0_xx) This can take some time.</li>
<li>Edit the file &quot;E:\Portables\Eclipse\eclipse.ini&quot; to<br />
<pre lang="text">
-vm
..\JDKsjdk1.5.0_xx\bin\javaw
-vmargs
-Xms40m
-Xmx256m
</pre> (replace &quot;jdk1.5.0_xx&quot; with the actual folder name) This is more elegant than using a batch file due to being independent from drive letters and path variables.</li>
<li>Run &quot;E:\Portables\Eclipse\eclipse.exe&quot;</li>
<li>When asked for a workspace location, you can enter &quot;.\workspace&quot;, which will create a workspace in your eclipse folder (like &quot;E:\Portables\Eclipse\workspace\&quot;)</li>
<li>Additionally I trimmed down my JDK install by removing the samples and demos directories.</li><li>
</li></ol>
