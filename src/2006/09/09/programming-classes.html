<p>Bah! I'm sick of C++.  Now that I'm learning Java, C++ just seems lame.  Then again, I haven't done any C++ in about a year, so I'm not terribly sharp on that front.  I spent a good two hours just wandering through my old books trying to remember how to do things like class specification files and the like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it took maybe an hour to write an assignment for my Java class, add in extra features to the class, do exception handling <strong>and</strong> learn enough about Ant to create a build file to handle compiling for me. Oh, and I wrote a shell script and a batch file to launch them jar.</p>
<p>I'm almost afraid to turn in the version I ended up with.  The assignment said to not bother with exception handling, so I'm not sure if all that other stuff would make me look like a know-it-all.  I'm not, it was just fun to do all the other stuff and learn the basics of it.  Whatever.  back to my C++...</p>
