title: DrumKit v0.01
type: post

<p>I finally started work on my DrumKit project today.  Essentially this is an attempt to create a electronic drum set from some pads, an old keyboard and a computer.  I got down to buisness and wrote up a Java app that plays back the drum sounds on key press events. It filters them and even handles shift for the hi-hat open/close, which I'll use to make the hi-hat pedal work.</p>
<p>The source is messy, and still has relative path's for the sound files.  Essentially it's a frame, a keylistener and some clips. Not too rough, though patching this together from the Java API and sparse information on javax.sound.sampled was tougher than I guessed it would be.  Anyway, it's got some bugs and features not implemented, but I can play drums with my keyboard now, which is a good start.</p>

<p style="border: 2px dashed #CCC; padding: 5px;">I suppose I should upload the code just in case, and to keep track of my versions.  You can get the source and the sounds for Version 0.01 below.  As a heads up, all the kit samples are absolute path'd for my machine, so you'll need to adjust them if you intend to compile it.<br/>&#187;<a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/projects/drumkit/DrumKit001.tar.gz"> DrumKit001.tar.gz</a> - Everything<br/>&#187;<a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/projects/drumkit/v001Source/DrumKit.java" target="_blank"> DrumKit.java</a> - Main class<br/>&#187;<a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/projects/drumkit/v001Source/KeyHandler.java" target="_blank"> KeyHandler.java</a> - Event listener</a><br/>&#187;<a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/projects/drumkit/v001Source/KitClip.java" target="_blank"> KitClip.java</a> - Kit sample class</p>
