I just finished reading a quick blurb on The Register about a proposed German law that deals with hacking.  The part I really find bad is 'a provision in the draft laws that would make it an offense to create or distribute "hacking tools" '.  Outlawing the various tools of the trade is absurd and dangerous.

Illegal to posses a port scanner?  I can't imagine the offense it would be to subscribe to a full disclosure mailing list.  What's more is that the black hats aren't going to let this slow them down, but law-abiding white hats just might.  That means less discovery of flaws, less disclose, and a more insecure world.  Why don't they think these things through?
