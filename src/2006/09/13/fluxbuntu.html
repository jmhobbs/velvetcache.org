<p>So I've got this real old Pentium III laptop.  It's a *shudder* Gateway no less. What makes it worse is that it ran Windows XP stock.  Thats insane, the thing moved like a rock, e.g. not at all unless you kicked it.  I've tried multiple different Linux disto's on it over the last year or so, and they were always a tad heavy, or a tad too stupid feeling (I'm looking at you IceWM).  The exception was FluxBox, which I experienced on the nUbuntu livecd about a month ago.</p>
<p>So, today I found <a href="http://www.fluxbuntu.org/" target="_blank">fluxbuntu</a>, and it rocked my world.  No more gnome or XFCE for me, I'm going fluxbox.  Loaded it up, and since it is an alpha, it isn't all that pretty.  So I made this nice background for it.  Anyway, if you have a spare machine, check out the fluxbuntu Alpha, it's pretty good (esp. for an alpha ;)</p>
