<p>I logged into my Yahoo! mail account today.  It's one I use for spam and dummy accounts, plus I insist on having at least 8 active email address because it keeps things interesting.  Anyway, I logged in and was prompted to try the new "Yahoo! Mail Beta".  It's actually very slick.  It's a full AJAX email client.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice is that it's not a Gmail clone.  It looks nothing like Gmail, and really acts very little like it.  It's more of a web-based Outlook or Thunderbird, and has a "desktop app" look and feel.  Anyway, I didn't use it much, but it has a so-so RSS reader built in and seems like a good application.  To bad it will never get any market share back from Gmail.</p>
