<p>I'd heard about <a href="http://katamari.namco.com/" target="_blank">Katamari Damacy</a> a long while back, when it was a Japanese game and people were importing it.  It took my this long to actually find one and check it out.</p>
<p>Amazing.  Very good game.</p>
<p><br/>P.S. Do you like my "Quick Post!" style?  I made it up.  Just now.  Amazing.</p>
