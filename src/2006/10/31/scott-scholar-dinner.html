<p>Had the Scott Scholar Dinner out at "the barn" tonight.  It was about as akward as the last two years.  This time I decided to just forget about that whole "socializing" thing and just hang around with Joe, Mike, and Bill.</p>
<p>I had a good time and lots of Coca-Cola, though I ate most of my tasty dinner without chewing much, I had a dental appointment earlier today.  Anyway, here are three cell phone snaps from the Scott's place.  They're actually from last year, but whatever.</p>

<p>P.S. I was sad that Dave wasn't there this year, but at least I got a high-five from Leland.</p>
