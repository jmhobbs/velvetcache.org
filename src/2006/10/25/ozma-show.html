<p>I saw Ozma at Knickerbockers in Lincoln last right.  Awesome show.  They played for a long time, and we got them to play an encore of Battlescars and Rocks as well.  Those guys are so awesome.</p>
<p>With them were "Everybody Else", who I liked.  They were, in Adam's words, "Rooney meets the Beach Boys".  Good band, though it took forever to get them set up so they didn't play as long (I think).</p>
<p>Also there was an amazing band from Lincoln that I have once again forgotten their name.  Wilson, or something.  Good bar band, the guitarist could really make his firebird scream.</p>
<p style="border: 2px dashed #CCC; padding: 3px;"><b>Update (10/25/06)</b><br/>The Lincoln band's name is <a href="http://ilikewillis.com/" target="_blank">Willis</a> and they are delicious.</p>
