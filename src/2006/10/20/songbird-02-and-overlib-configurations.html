<p><b>Songbird 0.2</b><br/>I saw that <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/" target="_blank">Songbird 0.2</a> was released on wednesday.  For anyone too bothered to go look it's a music-player/browser based off of Mozilla.  I got the developers preview and it's pretty slick.  I like it more than I did the first version, it's quicker for one.  I think this will be a good replacement for foobar2k on Windows for me.  It pales next to Amarok though.  Or maybe I'm an Amarok fan-boy, that could be too.  Anyway, good stuff, can't wait for 1.0</p>
<p><b>overLIB Configurations</b><br/>In other, um, news, I put up some of my overLIB configs on my <a href="http://static.velvetcache.org/projects/js/overlib_mod/" target="_blank">overlibMod page</a>.  An easy way to dress up your overLIB.  I noticed that the current overLIB (4.21) is over a year old now.  Maybe I need to find a new script.  Then again, it still works right?</p>
