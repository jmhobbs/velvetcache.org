<p>I was wandering through my log files and saw this failed http request:<br/><tt>/fluxbuntu/xf0j/t/x1b/x16/v+/xf0j/t/x1b/x14(-/xf0</tt></p>
<p>That looks like escaped hex or something to me.  Except the j's, don't get where they fit in.  Anyway, Google gave me nothing, so I suppose it's just an oddity I'll never know about.</p>
