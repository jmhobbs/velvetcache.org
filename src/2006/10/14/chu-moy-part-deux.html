<p>You thought I forgot about my <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2006/09/24/chu-moy-amplifier/" target="_blank">chu-moy amplifier</a> didn't you?  You thought it was lost to the depths of the boxes of parts and broken, half-made things in my room.  You thought wrong.  I recently aquired a highly rare container known as an "Altoids tin" and did the test fit of the pieces this evening.</p>
<p>If you ever want to put something in an altoids tin, measure it first.  I had to hack away parts of my c-board to get it in.  Also, poking holes and reaming them out with a knife and screwdriver aren't the optimal hole making solutions, but they do work.  It's a tight squeeze, but everything fits and it's lined in electrical tape for the circuits comfort.  Still not sure where the power switch will go.  I guess that can wait until I actually buy or scavenge a switch.</p>

<div style="border: 2px dashed #CCC; padding: 3px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Update (10/14/2006)</b><br/>I Found a switch while I was cleaning up my room.  It's from a busted computer PSU. Not going to fit in the case though, I think it will just live on the board.</div>
