Hello! This is my blog, hosted at https://velvetcache.org

It is on it's third platform (and fourth design) since I started it in 2006.  Transferring between these platform (homemade PHP, WordPress and 11ty) has accumulated some debt in the posts and URL structure, but all of the links should still work as they have for the past nearly 20 years ðŸ¤¯

That also explains why this is such a strange 11ty setup, it's got a lot to contort itself around from the WordPress era, so don't use this as a point of reference for creating an 11ty site in general.

I'll gladly accept bug fixes and typos!  Open an issue if you see something and I'll fix it up, or a PR if you are really ambitious.
